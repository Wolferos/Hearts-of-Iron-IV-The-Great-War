 GER_schlieffen_plan_desc:0 "We have tried negotiations with France to keep them out of the war between our alliance and the Russians, but such actions have failed.

The United Kingdom nominally backs Belgium, however, surely those cowards won't actually declare war on us in case of invasion. What should we do, Seiner Majestät?"
