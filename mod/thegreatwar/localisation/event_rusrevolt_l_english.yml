 rusrevolt.2.t:0 "The Tsar abdicates"
 rusrevolt.2.d:0 "Long war, low morale of the rebellious army, discontent with the autocrat and riots in the very center of the empire compel Nicholas II to abdicate. Now, when once again a revolution has taken place that overthrew the monarchy in Russia, the Provisional Government must be formed, which is obliged to withdraw the state from the gravest crisis. On the other hand, the Council of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies is being formed in Petrograd, which also aspires to the supreme power in Russia. It is very dangerous to give them an excuse for confrontation, so we should either listen to them or suppress their activities."

 rusrevolt.5.t:0 "The second revolution in Russia!"
 rusrevolt.5.d:0 "The world crisis and internal unrest in the Russian Empire forced Tsar Nicholas II Romanov to take extreme measures and abdicate the throne." The democratic opposition forms the Provisional Government, which has weak support from the working class of the country. Soon if the new Russian government does not make concessions to the growing strength of the Petrograd Soviet, which considers itself to be a full-fledged and sole legitimate body of supreme power, then perhaps we should expect an armed opposition within Russia.

 rusrevolt.6.t:0 "The storming of the Winter Palace"
 rusrevolt.6.d:0 "The failed policy of the Provisional Government all this time strongly influenced the popularity of the illegal Bolshevik Party. Ultimately, the Petrograd Soviet, which was almost completely controlled by the Bolsheviks, decided to seize power through an armed uprising. The Red Guard forces deprived the Provisional Government of the printing and telegraph office in the capital. Supporters of the government actually remained without strategically important facilities in Petrograd. The last stronghold of the Provisional Government was their residence - the Winter Palace in the heart of the city. The revolution is inevitable, it remains only to wait for the signal to begin the storming of the Winter Palace. There was a blank shot from the deck of the cruiser Aurora ..."

Throughout Russia, the flame of the socialist revolution flares up, which responds with a loud echo throughout the world. However, the scattered troops under the control of the Provisional Government are ready to repulse the Soviets, with which many may disagree. Perhaps, if Vladimir Lenin succeeds in defeating his opponent, can we talk about the beginning of the world revolution?"

 rusrevolt.7.b:0 "The Revolution was accomplished!"
