# [AUSTRIA-HUNGARIAN EMPIRE] Army Effort
#=========================================================================
AUH_ww1_army_effort:0 "Landstreitkräfte Österreich-Ungarns"
AUH_ww1_army_effort_desc:0 "Austria-Hungary's army is actually split into three jurisdictions: An Austrian force, a Hungarian force, and a joint unified force, all of which operate with their own officers and staff. Modernization of such a force is a tall order, but possible, and will inevitably lead to a more effective armed force." 

AUH_ww1_trenchwarfare:0 "Trench Warfare Focus"
AUH_ww1_trenchwarfare_desc:0 "Since Gatling and Maxim introduced their unholy weapons of warfare, our nation has been keenly interested in strategies based around the defense of Trench lines, which were first seen as far back as the American Civil War. We must seek experts in this theory- both field and armchair generals- in order to advance our knowledge in tomorrow's Land Doctrines."

AUH_ww1_artillery_effort_1:0 "Artillery Effort"
AUH_ww1_artillery_effort_1_desc:0 "One step to expand our young military modernization program is further development of our Artillery batteries. Seeking out designers for new weapons is a logical first step, and once our project is completed, we expect to reap the benefits of an easily-designed new Artillery piece."

AUH_ww1_artillery_effort_2:0 "Artillery Effort II"

AUH_ww1_artillery_effort_2_desc:0 "Now that we have gathered some accomplished Artillery designers, it seems logical to support their endeavors with their own factories. By assigning these men as full-time designers and engineers, and putting workers under them, we can easily make advancements in the field of Artillery." 

AUH_ww1_artillery_effort_3:0 "Artillery Effort III"
AUH_ww1_artillery_effort_3_desc:0 "Field tests are proving a major issue with our artillery pieces: The wide variety of calibers we're using for various ranges and models of Artillery is proving a costly endeavor, and reducing the effectiveness of our cannons on the field. By enforcing a few standard sizes for our guns, we can produce new models of Artillery that give us, quite literally, more bang for our buck." 

AUH_ww1_artillery_effort_4:0 "Artillery Effort IV"
AUH_ww1_artillery_effort_4_desc:0 "Though the direct-fire Field Gun was thought to be on its way out from the battlefield, our quartermasters are actually beginning to request more and more of these light pieces, instead of just demanding more of the Howitzers and Siege Guns. Focusing our efforts on new direct-fire guns, and perhaps more rounds to compensate, will not only inevitably lead to superior models, but perhaps lead to some unexpected advantages elsewhere as well..." 

AUH_ww1_special_forces:0 "Special Forces Focus"
AUH_ww1_special_forces_desc:0 "For all of its horror, Chemical Warfare has, by sheer accident, introduced us to a class of incredibly disciplined troops with lightning reaction times, superior to the other groups in our army. These men seem quite useful to act as Marines, Mountain troops, and other hardy classes of Infantry which are above the caliber of the standard Rifleman. Seeking out these men and good officers for them could lead to some much more effective Special Forces. If only there were a way for them to get to the battle faster, like the Cavalry of the old days..." 

AUH_ww1_army_motorization_focus:0 "Motorization Focus"
AUH_ww1_army_motorization_focus_desc:0 "Some of our geniuses in the General Staff- or perhaps just men fed up with the stalemates of Trench Wafare- have proposed mass-producing vehicles specifically for troop transportation, which would allow our men to get to and from battlefields faster- and, perhaps, around it as well. Of course, even this simple act requires specific equipment and training, which means an investment- though one that could easily pay off." 

AUH_ww1_doctrine_effort:0 "Doctrine Effort"
AUH_ww1_doctrine_effort_desc:0 "Though the era of the General Staff consisting of the princes of the realm has long ended, several of our Generals and other high-ranking officers were chosen for our armies not because of skill, but for connections or family ties. Though this keeps them loyal, other nations are beginning to become more serious and competitive with their own top brass. We must begin appointments for merit- though still, hopefully, not let too much of the common riff-raff into the esteemed General Staff..." 

AUH_ww1_doctrine_effort_2:0 "Doctrine Effort II"
AUH_ww1_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "Though our General Staff has now been made thoroughly merit-based, perhaps they aren't the only ones who can assist in our military doctrines. A class of men who have been mostly dormant since the early 1800s- straight military theorists- are beginning to appear once again. Though many of these men have limited combat experience, their study in war cannot be ignored. Integrating them into our staff could prove beneficial for our military tactics." 

AUH_ww1_doctrine_effort_3:0 "Doctrine Effort III"
AUH_ww1_doctrine_effort_3_desc:0 "One of our critical elements of warfare has largely been ignored up to now: Logistics. With so much focus on the capability of troops in combat, we must ensure they get there in a timely fashion, and have, at least, food, water, and a weapon. Giving experts on this subject a voice, as well as more training for supply vehicle drivers, would have immediate benefits for our land doctrines, but perhaps future additional benefits as well." 

AUH_ww1_equipment_effort:0 "Equipment Effort"
AUH_ww1_equipment_effort_desc:0 "Our generals are not the only old guard keeping our military in the last century. Our Quartermasters still have some of the 19th century Military issues of corruption and disconnection behind them. By selecting the most well-liked and in-tune officers, we can, most importantly, learn the faults of our current weapons, allowing us to produce corrected and improved designs more quickly- as well as ensure that these men don't get TOO popular!" 

AUH_ww1_equipment_effort_2:0 "Equipment Effort II"
AUH_ww1_equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "Our new Quartermasters have taken to us with requests for not simply newer rifles, but newer support weapons as well. Experience with this new-pattern army has led to ideas like lighter machine guns, trench mortars, and rifle grenades, which all seem quite useful, so long as we can get the right people on designing them and manufacturing them." 

AUH_ww1_equipment_effort_3:0 "Equipment Effort III"
AUH_ww1_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "The Quartermasters have sent a letter of demands for more rifles equipped for the conditions of trenches- those able to launch rifle grenades, attach bayonets or scopes, and more carbines. Though we could simply produce more straight up, it seems like a logical move is to bring our rifles to the standard of being able to do all of these things- which means a new, improved design." 

AUH_ww1_equipment_effort_4:0 "Equipment Effort IV"
AUH_ww1_equipment_effort_4_desc:0 "Our Quartermasters have, unfortunately, sent us yet another list of demands. Luckily, we have instructed our postmasters to ignore any further mail from them. Their last demand is new equipment for our Engineer corps- new models of Carbine, new tools, and perhaps those new Flamethrowers, which will be commissioned as soon as possible. Of course, expanding the Engineer corps as such could provide for some unseen benefits..." 

AUH_ww1_armor_effort_1:0 "Panzer Effort"
AUH_ww1_armor_effort_1_desc:0 "Our prior investments have paid off! Artillery designers, Engineers, and vehicle designers have proposed to us a brand new type of vehicle- a heavily armored tractor with a direct fire gun. Though early designs are clearly not battle ready, this concept has strong promise- particularly in the field of ending the Trench stalemate in our favor, if these landships can stand up to machine gun fire, as is claimed."

AUH_ww1_armor_effort_2:0 "Panzer Effort II"
AUH_ww1_armor_effort_2_desc:0 "Our experiments with armor have been a rousing success! However, we cannot be complacent with our current designs. Engineers have been proposing interesting concepts like rotating gun turrets, specific engine compartments, and a hatch for use by a commander, which cannot be ignored. If we are to be the first to make these ideas a reality, perhaps we could become unstoppable!"

AUH_ww1_gasmask_focus:0 "Chemical Warfare Focus"
AUH_ww1_gasmask_focus_desc:0 "Some of our chemists have proposed the use of a new, incredibly deadly agent- poisonous gas, delivered by our artillery and trench mortars. Though chemical warfare has been frowned on for roughly a century, what choice do we have if we are to win the war? Beyond investing in these, it's also likely for the best to develop countermeasures quickly- it would be unfortunate for such an advancement to turn on us!"

# [AUSTRIA-HUNGARIAN EMPIRE] Aviation Effort
#=========================================================================
AUH_ww1_aviation_effort:0 "Form K.u.K. Luftfahrtruppen"
AUH_ww1_aviation_effort_desc:0 "These new Aeroplanes are interesting toys, and perhaps hold some military value. Civilian pilots could easily be attracted to our military, experts could teach us how to use these newfangled contraptions, and if this project bears fruit, we may earn ourselves a decisive advantage over our opponents who fall behind in this field- particularly in the doctrines of these aircraft."

AUH_ww1_fighter_focus:0 "Fighter Focus"
AUH_ww1_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The value of the Fighter is unquestionable. If we focus our aviation efforts on the ddsign and use of these air craft, our nation's planes may one day flood the sky, destroying all enemy aircraft that even try to oppose them, which could provide a major advantage. Of course, the Bomber lobby has interesting proposals as well, so perhaps we should not put all of our eggs into one basket..."

AUH_ww1_bomber_focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
AUH_ww1_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The Bomber is a simple, practical machine. Focusing our production and designers on this specific class of aircraft would be a good way to ensure that we can use the Air Force as a ground support tool, able to help the infantry gain ground by destroying enemy defenses and positions. Of course, fighters should still be produced, but these bombers may win us the war." 

AUH_ww1_airship_focus:0 "Zeppelin Focus"
AUH_ww1_airship_focus_desc:0 "The Balloon is our oldest aircraft, and even now, experts are predicting that it may not have a long future on the battlefield. This is no excuse to slack on the designs of such craft, especially in a time when they may be an effective way to drop large bomb payloads onto our foes. By bringing out-of-work Hot Air Balloon and Zeppelin manufacturers under the state's wing, we could squeeze the most out of this design while we still can." 

AUH_ww1_aviation_effort_2:0 "Aviation Effort"
AUH_ww1_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Now that we have formally established an Air Force, we have made some interesting advances. Most notably, our aircraft designers have been proposing designs for specific roles, rather than simply arming a generic model. Getting effective use out of these planes, which will be designed with roles like attacking enemy aircraft or dropping bombs in mind, will require extensive testing and research, but will no doubt prove beneficial." 
AUH_ww1_aviation_effort_3:0 "Aviation Effort II"
AUH_ww1_aviation_effort_3_desc:0 "The development of the Synchronised Machine Gun has changed the rules of the Aircraft game. Fighters are now far more effective, our Zeppelins might be seeing their last flights, and we need innovative thinkers to help keep us on pace with this extreme development. If we become the master of this new development, which will perhaps change the air war as much as ground warfare, we will be well on our way to Air Superiority." 
AUH_ww1_aviation_effort_4:0 "Aviation Effort III"
AUH_ww1_aviation_effort_4_desc:0 "Our Air Force, which was established only recently, has now integrated itself completely into the rest of our armed forces. This brings us the obvious benefit of a pool of theorists, engineers, designers, and experts still at our door- as well as a new class of ''Ace'' pilots, who are even becoming minor celebrities. Hiring on these people certainly can't hurt us, and will lead to nice developments in our field." 
AUH_ww1_aviation_effort_5:0 "Aviation Effort IV"
AUH_ww1_aviation_effort_5_desc:0 "With the development of brand new types of aircraft, such as the Tactical and Strategic Bomber, we have yet more testing and theorycrafting to do on exactly the best way to get use out of this influx of new models. Some are already speculating that bombers may be a wonder weapon capable of deciding a war. What poppycock!"

AUH_ww1_pilotformation_1:0 "Pilot Formation"
AUH_ww1_pilotformation_1_desc:0 "Currently, Aircraft fly solo- distant from each other, and engaging in one-on-one duels with any enemies they might encounter. However, with more and more machines in the sky, it's becoming clear that this is no longer the most viable way to engage in air combat. Some of our physicists may be valuable in helping us to determine new formations for our pilots to use."

AUH_ww1_pilotformation_2:0 "Pilot Formation II"
AUH_ww1_pilotformation_2_desc:0 "The new formations we have established have indeed been a boon to us in combat. However, ensuring people stick to the formations is a different story entirely. Encouraging our top aces to put out a manual for our pilots on air tactics and formation will ensure our pilots stick to doing what's best- and perhaps, these sorts of writings will help spread new tricks and doctrines."

AUH_ww1_aircraftprod_1:0 "Aircraft Production"
AUH_ww1_aircraftprod_1_desc:0 "Though Engineers have been making aircraft for us on a decent scale, it is simply time to introduce factories outright to the concept. Putting planes into mass production will help us flood the sky with friendly craft- and, more importantly, help us deprive our enemies of the same advantage. On top of that, who knows? Maybe some of these factory engineers may have some good ideas for aircraft designs..."

AUH_ww1_aircraftprod_2:0 "Aircraft Production II"
AUH_ww1_aircraftprod_2_desc:0 "The new formations we have established have indeed been a boon to us in combat. However, ensuring people stick to the formations is a different story entirely. Encouraging our top aces to put out a manual for our pilots on air tactics and formation will ensure our pilots stick to doing what's best- and perhaps, these sorts of writings will help spread new tricks and doctrines."

AUH_ww1_airbomb_1:0 "Air Bombing Effort"
AUH_ww1_airbomb_1_desc:0 "While the tactics of our fighters are improving with formations, our bombers are still very basic machines with very basic doctrines. Some of our old airship bombers possess now essentially unused expertise, which could help the latter as time solves the former. By utilizing these men, we can ensure that the old lessons of bombing are not lost on newer craft."
AUH_ww1_airbomb_2:0 "Air Bombing Effort II"
AUH_ww1_airbomb_2_desc:0 "All of the recent developments to air warfare, both in theory and in practice, have given birth to a golden age of aircraft development. From pilots down to the plane mechanics, it seems that everyone has something to improve and potentially offer, which we can use on a national level. Perhaps one day, Aircraft may be the most important weapon in war...nah, probably not." 

AUH_ww1_air_innovation:0 "Air Innovation Focus"
AUH_ww1_air_innovation_desc:0 "One of our aspiring, mid-level air officers recently displayed the conclusion of a project he had been working on in secret. A seaplane was launched from a static ship, dropped a bomb onto one of our old scrappers, sinking the poor old vessel, before the plane returned and docked once again. Though most of our high command was unimpressed, attention from the head of state could certainly give this ambition a boost." 

AUH_ww1_navalair:0 "Naval Bombing Effort"
AUH_ww1_navalair_desc:0 "One of our aspiring, mid-level air officers recently displayed the conclusion of a project he had been working on in secret.

We should start negotiations with them, in order to establish more amicable relations, if we hope to keep them in our alliance. Of course, if we go through with this, we'll probably end up losing territory..."

AUH_ww1_give_italy_territories:0 "Give South Tyrol and Istria"
AUH_ww1_give_italy_territories_descn:0 "The Italians have made their demands clear: The historically Italian region of Istria, as well as a concession around the city of Split on the Dalmatian coast. Unfortunately, this is all coastal territory, but it might be a price worth paying to keeep Italy aligned with the Central Powers." 

AUH_ww1_italy_honnor_pact:0 "Call Italy to War"
AUH_ww1_italy_honnor_pact_desc:0 "Italy is now essentially forced to join up in a war with us. If we've send them territory and promised them more from France for nothing, their people will give the government hell. Now that things have broken out, it's time to collect our dues for handing out some of our prized regions."


 AUH_ww1_assert_position_east:0 "Assert Position in the East "
 AUH_ww1_assert_position_east_desc:0 "The position of the Central Powers in the East is the same- weaken Russia, and build hegemony in the region. As war with Russia in particular seems to be nearly inevitable, due to the Balkan situation, this is an effective course of action to take, though will drive France and Russia closer, which could prove to be an issue."

 AUH_ww1_anti_ru:0 "Anti-Russian Policy"
 AUH_ww1_anti_ru_desc:0 "To make good on our position, we shall sever most diplomatic ties with Russia, and begin to publicly work against them. This will likely do little but anger them for now, but it will open to us a host of options to deal with them in the future."

 AUH_ww1_anti_ru_limit_trade:0 "Limit Trade with Russia"
 AUH_ww1_anti_ru_limit_trade_desc:0 "Russia is one of our major trade partners, and we are in a fortunate position where they need us more than we need them. By placing sanctions and tariffs on Russian products, we can ensure that we get an edge over them economically."

 AUH_ww1_rom:0 "Romanian Rapprochement"
 AUH_ww1_rom_desc:0 "The Romanians are a thorn in our side. We control a large portion of their territory, and though they're officially a minor member of the Triple Alliance, there is no doubt that they eye our territory with envy. We should extend good tidings out to them, to try and get them back closer to the winning team. Of course, to truly win them over might take concession..."

 AUH_ww1_rom_give_bucovina:0 "Give Bucovina to Romania"
 AUH_ww1_rom_give_bucovina_desc:0 "Bucovina is not a significant amount of territory, but it's some of the most Romanian land in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Conceding this territory is not guaranteed to win their heart, but it's certainly worth making an offer- we're a lot better off with a solid ally than a few inches of land."

 AUH_ww1_rom_honnor_pact:0 "Call Romania to War"
 AUH_ww1_rom_honnor_pact_desc:0 "Since Romania accepted our offer of Bucovina, we are in a good position to call them into the current conflict. There is no doubt that if they decline, their people will be most displeased with them."

 AUH_ww1_oirganization_realm:0 "Organize the Realm"
 AUH_ww1_oirganization_realm_desc:0 "Austria-Hungary, as a collection of parts of old kingdoms, is not in a great defensive position. Despite this, however, we can fortify and entrench our troops, to try and hold back the brunt of an offense on any of our broad borders." 

 AUH_ww1_fortify_russian_borders:0 "Fortify Russian Borders"
 AUH_ww1_fortify_russian_borders_desc:0 "The Galician region is one of keen strategic interest, and keeping the Russians out is important if we want to keep an advantage in the East. A fortification line in that region will help beat back the bear."

 AUH_ww1_airport_russian_borders:0 "Build Airports near Russian Borders"
 AUH_ww1_airport_russian_borders_desc:0 "The advent of combat aeroplanes may very well be a deciding factor in the war in the East. If we build airstrips out this way early and well, we can host more planes in the region, making it a more likely prospect to break enemy air superiority and, by extension, win crucial battles in the region."

 AUH_ww1_fortify_italian_borders:0 "Fortify Italian Borders"
 AUH_ww1_fortify_italian_borders_desc:0 "The Italian border is long and oddly curved, making it difficult for units to support each other. Worse yet, the Italians themselves are entrenched at the bottoms of mountain chains and in fortified urban areas. Since we are unlikely to break into it any time soon, we must be sure that we can at the very least defend from that direction."

 AUH_ww1_fortify_bosnia_borders:0 "Fortify Balkans Borders"
 AUH_ww1_fortify_bosnia_borders_desc:0 "It is highly unlikely that the Balkans will give us serious issues, but it is always better to be safe than sorry, lest French marines arriving in the region give us a rude awakening. It will also deny Serbia and Montenegro the chance to attack into our territory to any degree, further making for a safe Balkan campaign."

 AUH_ww1_fortify_coast_dalmatia:0 "Fortify the Dalmatian Coast"
 AUH_ww1_fortify_coast_dalmatia_desc:0 "Though we don't have a very strong navy, we still posess a long coastline, which must be defended if a front from the Balkans to Italy is not to be established, which would be a disaster for our war effort. Improving existing coastal forts and construction of new ones can help make sure that we never have to face that nightmare scenario." 

 AUH_ww1_ready_country:0 "Recruitment Propaganda"
 AUH_ww1_ready_country_desc:0 "According to Austria-Hungary, the Austro-Hungarian army is the most prestigous employer in the world. By circulating positive news and information about our country and armed forces, we can build enthusiasm in otherwise apathetic men, helping our military out."

 AUH_ww1_polnische_wehrmacht:0 "Polnische Wehrmacht"
 AUH_ww1_polnische_wehrmacht_desc:0 "If we promise the Poles their own nationstate after the war, perhaps the residents of our part of Poland will be more willing to join in on the action. Whether we cede the territory or not is, of course, a matter to be decided yet, but for now, we can enjoy the influx of able-bodied men without thinking of the consequences." 
 
 AUH_ww1_military_harmonization:0 "Military Harmonization"
 AUH_ww1_military_harmonization_desc:0 "An army with 3 subdivisions in its land forces alone is no easy thing to keep in check, but lately our officers have become more accustomed to dealing with the intricacies of such a force. As our military begins to operate more organically and in a more unified fashion, more ideas are coming to the top level, which is beneficial to our doctrine."

 AUH_ww1_balkans_policy:0 "Balkans Policy"
 AUH_ww1_balkans_policy_desc:0 "Since acquiring and annexing Bosnia, we have sought to keep our stake in the Balkans safe, and, admittedly, keep expanding in that area if we get an easy, cheap opportunity to. By establishing our argument on the world stage, we can become more actively involved in the politics of the Balkan region." 

 AUH_ww1_balkans_policy_intervene:0 "First Balkan War Reaction"
 AUH_ww1_balkans_policy_intervene_desc:0 "The Balkan War was an interesting experience, particularly from showing the surprising potential strength of these Balkan states when unified. Though we were supporting the Ottoman Empire, it seems that their power in this region has eroded completely. Perhaps Austria needs to find a new nearby friend, if we are ever to keep what we have here?" 

 AUH_ww1_balkans_bulgaria_friend:0 "Send Military Advisors"
 AUH_ww1_balkans_bulgaria_friend_desc:0 "The Bulgarians are in a tough spot right now. Their war against Serbia has spilled over into a conflict with literally every single one of their neighbors. If we don't send at least advisors, it could be over for them. This is also, of course, an interesting opportunity to make friends with one of these Balkan states..."

 AUH_ww1_balkans_bulgaria_send_troops:0 "Send Troops to help Bulgaria"
 AUH_ww1_balkans_bulgaria_send_troops_desc:0 "To ensure Bulgaria at least has a fighting chance not to get annexed, we can send in some of our own troops, nominally volunteers, to try and give Bulgaria at least some edge in the conflict. This will provide some much-needed experience, and keep pushing Bulgaria more into our corner."

 AUH_ww1_balkans_serbian_expansion:0 "Investigate Serbian Expansionism"
 AUH_ww1_balkans_serbian_expansion_desc:0 "Though the Serbians were once allied to our state, since we've annexed Bosnia, things have been much less friendly betwen the Serbian government. Due to a sharp uptick in crime, especially from recent immigrants of Serbia right on the inside our borders, an investigation on Serbian activities in Austria must be carried out."

 AUH_ww1_balkans_serbian_ultimatum:0 "Send Ultimatum to Serbia"
 AUH_ww1_balkans_serbian_ultimatum_desc:0 "So, the Serbian bastards WERE just trying to stir up rebellions to get their grubby hands on our South Slavic provinces! They should be punished for this clear breach of trust, and our good Kaiser has begun to prepare an ultimatum to the Serbian government, which they surely will be in no position to refuse."

 AUH_ww1_annex_BOS:0 "Total Annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina"
 AUH_ww1_annex_BOS_desc:0 "Bosnia has been technically a part of our realm since 1908, though the process of completely establishing it in our empire has, to this point, been so slow that they still have some measure of autonomy within our realm here years later. This state of affairs benefits no one. Of course, the question now becomes ''Will Austria, Hungary, or perhaps both rule this state?''"

 AUH_ww1_Schutzkorps:0 "Form More Schutzkorps"
 AUH_ww1_Schutzkorps_desc:0 "The Schutzkorps was an auxiliary volunteer militia established by Austro-Hungarian authorities in the newly annexed province of Bosnia and Herzegovina to track down Bosnian Serb opposition."
