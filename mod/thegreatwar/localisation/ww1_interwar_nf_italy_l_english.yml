ITA_interwar_march_on_rome_desc:0 "Mussolini's new Fascism is on the rise in Italy, and may soon plunge the country into Civil War if opposed too violently. He has begun a peaceful March on Rome, demanding to be put into power. Do we truly have a choice in this matter?"

ITA_interwar_abyssinia_crisis:0 "Abyssinia Crisis"
ITA_interwar_abyssinia_crisis_desc:0 "The sting of Italian defeat still lives in the borders of our East African colonies, with the crown jewel we deserve- Ethiopia- still independent. Though the Western Allies have promised Italy a few concessions in the East in exchange for backing off, what good are those weasels' words? Italy answers to none, and certainly no league of nations! Ethiopia must be ours!"
