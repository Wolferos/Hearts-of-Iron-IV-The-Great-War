Faced with the refusal,The two commanders then retired to begin the battle, ordering General Gomez to open fire to prevent the advance of the Americans. At the beginning of the battle, Gómez was mortally wounded, taking the command Lieutenant Colonel Rivas; Boyd died shortly afterwards and another officer named Morey was injured; The invaders, seeing themselves without bosses, surrendered after suffering severe losses.This hard-fought battle lasted about three hours and further tightened relations between the two countries. However, the US government was more concerned about its increasingly deteriorating relations with the German government and wanted to avoid two possible fronts in case of war with Germany, decided to solve its problems with Mexico. A treaty was agreed upon in which it was felt that the punitive expedition should leave the country.This provoked a new sense of patriotism in the north of the country as there were a large number of volunteers who were quickly trained and enlisted in the Mexican army for fear of a strong counterattack by Pershing."

With signing of the secret treaty between the German and the Ottoman Empire on 2nd August 1914 it was agreed that the mission should stay in Constantinople. It was promised that the mission would get a vast influence on the conduct of war of the Ottoman army. Many German officers would hold leadership positions. Numerous officers, specialists and troops were deployed during the war. It is estimated that approximately 25,000 men were in use for the military mission. The Ottoman army was supplied with weapons and aircrafts. Since the sea was locked, material and human support could only be sent overland to the Ottoman Empire. Since the German Empire was at war with Serbia, the supply could only be sent through neutral Romania, but this was not enough.
