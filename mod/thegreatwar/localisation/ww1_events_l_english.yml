After months of negotiations, the second German military mission arrived in Constantinople in December 1913 under the leadership of Otto Liman von Sanders. Actually it was scheduled that the military mission would withdraw in case of war. With signing of the secret treaty between the German and the Ottoman Empire on 2nd August 1914 it was agreed that the mission should stay in Constantinople. It was promised that the mission would get a vast influence on the conduct of war of the Ottoman army. Many German officers would hold leadership positions. Numerous officers, specialists and troops were deployed during the war. It is estimated that approximately 25,000 men were in use for the military mission. The Ottoman army was supplied with weapons and aircrafts. Since the sea was locked, material and human support could only be sent overland to the Ottoman Empire. Since the German Empire was at war with Serbia, the supply could only be sent through neutral Romania, but this was not enough. However in mid-September 1914 Romania refused the transit permit and so the Ottoman Empire was cut off from support from the German Empire. Only with the occupation of Serbia, the Ottoman Empire was able to be supplied with war material again."

The new groups (named 'Pascha II') reached the Ottoman Empire in August 1917. Colonel Werner von Frankenberg und Proschlitz was made commander of the 'Asienkorps'. In addition, in June 1917, the staff of the Ottoman Army Group F was completely replaced by German officers and renamed to 'Heeresgruppe Yildirim' (Army Group Thunderbolt). General Erich von Falkenhayn was made commander. To this army group there were assigned three Ottoman armies and the 'Asienkorps'.\nThe initial goal was the reconquest of Baghdad, which was abandoned in October 1917. The 'Asienkorps' was moved to Palestine to stabilize the front. In 1918, the 'Asienkorps' was strengthened again and achieved a strength of 16,000 men.\nTo the 'Asienkorps' also belonged 6 Fliegerabteilungen (flier detachements) and 1 Jagdstaffel (hunting squadron) with a total of about 70 aircrafts.
