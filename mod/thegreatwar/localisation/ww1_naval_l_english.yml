ENG_destroyer_1890:0 "A/B/C/D Class"
ENG_destroyer_1890_desc:0 "The A/B/C/D class destroyers were built in the 1890s. A widely varied group of ships whose only common features were thier top speeds. A class 26/27-knots, B class 4-funneled 30-knots, C class 3-funneled 30-knots, and D class 2-funneled 30 knots. The naming of ships with the first letter of thier name being the class designation did not come into effect in the Royal Navy until 1913. 
ENG_destroyer_1906:0 "F/G/H/I/K/L Class"
ENG_destroyer_1906_desc:0 "Beginning with the F (Tribal) class in 1905, the Royal Navy began to shift towards oil-fueled ships instead of coal. This greatly increased the speed and range of ships. Fear of oil shortages prompted the G (Beagle) class to return to coal but they were the last British destroyers to be coal burning. The H (Acorn), I (Acheron), K (Acasta), and L (Laforey) class ships were built between 1910 and 1915.
ENG_destroyer_1914:0 "M Class"
ENG_destroyer_1914_desc:0 "Offically known as the 'Admiralty M class', they were a class of 85 destroyers built for the Royal Navy that saw service during World War I. All ships were built to an identical 'Admiralty' design, hence the class name. Twenty-five other vessels of the 'M' class were built to variant designs by three specialist builders Thornycroft, Yarrow, and Hawthorn Leslie."

ENG_light_cruiser_1890:0 "Apollo/ Astrea Class"
ENG_light_cruiser_1890_desc:0 "Twenty-one of the Apollo class cruisers were built under the 1889 Naval Defence Act, along with eight to a modified design (the Astraea class). By the last year of the First World War, the surviving ships were outdated, and six of this class were converted into blockships to be scuttled in the entrances to enemy-occupied ports in Belgium."
ENG_light_cruiser_1906:0 "Town Class, 1910"
ENG_Light_cruiser_1906_desc:0 "The Town class was a group of twenty-one light cruisers built for the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy. These vessels were long-range cruisers, suitable for patrolling the vast expanse covered by the British Empire. These ships, initially rated as second class cruisers, were built to a series of designs all having the names of British towns except for the RAN ships, which were named after Australian cities."

ENG_light_cruiser_1914:0 "C Class"
ENG_Light_cruiser_1914_desc:0 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."

ENG_battle_cruiser_1890:0 "Diadem Class"
ENG_battle_cruiser_1890_desc:0 "The Diadem-class cruiser was a class of 'first class' protected cruiser built for the Royal Navy during the 1890s that served in the First World War.They were  criticised for their lack of a heavy calibre main armament, bulky unprotected sides, slow speed and lack of manoeuvrability. They were the last British first class protected cruisers; the armoured cruiser taking the large cruiser role in future."
ENG_battle_cruiser_1890b:0 "Cressy Class"
ENG_battle_cruiser_1890b_desc:0 "The Cressy-class cruiser was a class of six armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy around 1900. Their design's incorporation of a pair of 9.2-inch guns and armoured sides served to address criticism directed against the previous Diadem class"
ENG_battle_cruiser_1906:0 "Invincilbe Class"
ENG_battle_cruiser_1906_desc:0 "The Invincible-class ships were the first battlecruisers in the world. The design resembled that of HMS Dreadnought, but sacrificed armour protection and one gun turret from the main battery for a speed advantage."
#ENG_battl_ecruiser_1906b:0 "Indefatigible Class"
ENG_battle_cruiser_1914:0 "Renown Class"
ENG_battle_cruiser_1914_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."

ENG_battleship_1890:0 "Pre-Dreadnought Class"
ENG_battleship_1890_desc:0 "By the late 1880s pressure on the government to modernise and expand the Royal Navy was building. A war scare with Russia in 1885, and various official reports revealed serious weaknesses in the Navy. The Government responded with the Naval Defence Act 1889, which provided £21.5 million for a vast expansion programme of which the eight ships of the Royal Sovereign class were the centrepiece. The Act also formalised the two-power standard, whereby the Royal Navy sought to be as large as the next two major naval powers combined. Between 1890 and 1906 more than 50 battleships of several different classes were constructed."

ENG_battleship_1906_desc:0 "Fast, well-armoured, and armed with only large calibre guns HMS Dreadnought made every other capital ship in the world obsolete. Laid down in October 1905 and completed in December 1906, it set a record for battleship construction that was never equalled. The very similar Bellerophon, St. Vincent, Neptune, and Colossus Classes quickly followed."

ENG_battleship_1914_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Programme. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
#ENG_battleship_1914b: "Revenge Class"

ENG_carrier_1914:0 "Seaplane Carriers"
ENG_carrier_1914_desc:0 "The Royal Navy had conducted trials in 1913 with a modified cruiser, Hermes, to evaluate the ability of seaplanes to work with the fleet. They were successful enough that the Admiralty allocated £81,000 in the 1914–1915 Naval Programme to purchase a merchant ship for a more thorough modification than had been possible with Hermes. HMS Ark Royal was the first ship in history designed and built as a seaplane carrier. She was purchased by the Royal Navy in 1914 shortly after her keel had been laid and the ship was only in frames; this allowed the ship's design to be modified almost totally to accommodate seaplanes. By the end of WW1 the Royal Navy had 14 seaplane carriers in service" 

ENG_submarine_1906:0 "D Class"
ENG_submarine_1906_desc:0 "Thanks to the diesel-electric engine the D-class submarine was the Royal Navy's first class of submarines capable of operating significantly beyond coastal waters. They were also the first boats to be fitted with wireless transmitters. All ten were laid down between 1907 and 1910."
ENG_coastal_submarine_1906:0 "A/B/C Class"
ENG_coastal_submarine_1906_desc:0 "The first submarines in the Royal Navy had petrol-electric engines, their range was limited." 

ENG_submarine_1914:0 "E Class"
ENG_submarine_1914_desc:0 "The British E class submarines started out as improved versions of the British D class submarine. The E class served with the Royal Navy throughout World War I as the backbone of the submarine fleet and were eventually replaced by the L class submarine. All the E class submarines were withdrawn from service by 1922."
ENG_coastal_submarine_1914:0 "F Class"
ENG_coastal_submarine_1914_desc:0 "The F class submarine was built for the Royal Navy as a coastal submarine based on the doubled hulled V class submarine with very few minor improvements. The only important improvement was the addition of a stern torpedo tube. The F class were ordered as a successor to the E class submarine, but only three were built out of the ten ordered."
