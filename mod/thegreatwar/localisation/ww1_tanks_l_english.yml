 tank_unlocker1_desc:0 "Some of our Artillery captains have proposed an armored artillery tractor for use on the battlefield. While this sort of design is unlikely to go anwhere- or, for that matter, unlikely to even be built yet- it is the first important step to ensuring that these sorts of ideas might one day come into reality."

 tank_unlocker2_desc:0 "While the idea of an armored artillery-carrying vehicle is nothing new, a design capable of doing so would be. Constructing a basic tank prototype will likely not lead to any direct results on the battlefield, but a further, more conventional design could easily come out of such a design."

 TANK_UNLOCKER_SPECIAL:0 "The development of a Tank Prototype is an essential prerequisite for the development of conventional Tanks. This technology must be researched before you can research advanced tanks."
 TANK_UNLOCKER_RESEARCHED:0 "Allows research of additional tank technologies"

 ww1_armored_car_equipment_1_desc:0 "While the Automobile is still young technology, it is already being considered for military purposes. A design as simple as putting a machine gun on one of these new automobiles and attaching some more metal to act as armor could give us an interesting new weapon to use in battle."

 ww1_armored_car_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Armored Car is still capable of evolving. By putting our main Machine Gun into a rotating turret, we can ensure that all of our crewmen are protected, increasing the efficiency of the vehicle, and its practicality in battle."

 ww1_armored_car_equipment_3_desc:0 "As Cavalry play less and less of a role on the battlefield, Armored Cars seem to be the logical way to fill the same role in a much more safe manner. Upgrading the engine and suspension systems of our Armored Cars to give them an increase in speed and mobility may be a good way to help them in this endeavor."

 ww1_armored_car_equipment_4_desc:0 "With the Tank beginning to arrive on the battlefield, our Armored Cars may seem obsolete, but these cheaper and easier to produce models can still serve our military well. Minor upgrades to the armor of these vehicles, to be able to at least survive minor blasts, should help keep them competitive."

 ww1_armored_car_equipment_5_desc:0 "As our tanks evolve, we still cannot forget to ensure our Armored Cars are modern as well. Adding small cannons, or perhaps autocannons, as the main gun of these vehicles will give make them more threatening on the battlefield, but still mobile and cost-effective."

 ww1_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Heavier tanks are all well and good, but a lighter, more mobile tank that could keep up with the Cavalry is an interesting proposition indeed, especially if it utilizes a rotating turret. Though some argue that a lesser-armored lighter tank will be less effective, the potential of the role cannot be ignored."
 ww1_light_tank_equipment_b_desc:0 "While our new Light Tanks have exceeded expectations so far, they are only armed with Machine Guns, making them ineffective against enemy fortifications or vehicles. Replacing the MG with a cannon would hurt the Light Tank's anti-Infantry potential, unless we found somewhere else to put it, but make it a more effective vehicle-fighting platform."
 ww1_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "If we mount a Machine Gun directly next to a cannon in a Light Tank in what our Engineers call a coaxial mounting, we can have the best of both worlds- a light tank able to fight enemy vehicles and still effective against enemy infantry. Perhaps one day this shall be the world standard?"

 ww1_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The development of a Tank Prototype has brought the reality of an armored, gun-carrying, and treaded vehicle nearly to reality. Improvements on the design, most importantly making it viable for mass-production and able to travel over trenches consistently, can give us a battle-ready vehicle to break through enemy lines."
 ww1_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Improvements on the Heavy Tank design are necessary if the vehicle is to stay useful in the changing combat situation. Universal-type treads and more seperated engines are required to ensure that these landships can continue fighting until the end of their battles, and improvements to gun positioning can give us a further edge."

 ww1_super_heavy_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Perhaps the future of Tank design echoes that of the future of ships. If we simply make our tanks bigger, better armored, and add more guns, though they will be far costlier, they'll be much more effective in battle. Our engineers are warning us that if Anti-Tank technologies advance, these would become giant coffins, but what are the chances of that?"

 ww1_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Civilian Automobile industry has had a boom in recent years, particularly in regards to engine horsepower. If we equip our Light Tanks with superior Engines, we'll be able to both increase the speed and weight capacity of our light tanks, leading to faster, more well-armed models."

 ww1_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Lighter tanks may have lesser armament, but their turrets are proving to be a massive advantage in battle. If we are to install these rotating turrets onto our Heavy Tanks, they can themselves have this same advantage, as well as retaining the benefit of their heavier armor."
