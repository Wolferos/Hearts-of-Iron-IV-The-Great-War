 ww1_camera1_desc:0 "The Vest Pocket Cameras are folding cameras designed for use by the troops for reconaissance purposes, popularized by Eastman-Kodak. Their use of smaller 127 film reels makes them portable enough for anyone to carry and use, and they should be a boon to our ability to report on enemy actions and movements accurately in combat."

 ww1_camera2_desc:0 "The Pocket Cameras have been a success, but further developments could help further. Improved stabilizers may help troops on horseback or in vehicles, and a camera useful for taking pictures from aircraft could all combine to ensure that the Generals and officers see what the recon sees."


 ww1_camera3:0 "Propaganda Films"
 ww1_camera3_desc:0 "Our widespread use of cameras for the war effort has given us a large amount of talented photographers who often have little to do. Additionally, Motion Picture distribution is becoming simpler. By hiring some of our talented cameramen (and sometimes even women) to make propaganda films celebrating the glory of our nation, we can ensure that our citizens think we're the best damn country in the world."
