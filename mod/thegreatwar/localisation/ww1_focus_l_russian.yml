 TUR_army_effort_desc:0 "Despite the increasing possibilities of aerial and naval warfare, ground combat is still key in tomorrow's wars. With preparation, we can avoid reliving the hell of the trenches."
 TUR_equipment_effort_desc:0 "The limits for what equipment can be carried by infantry are constantly being pushed. We will focus on giving our troops the best tools available."
 TUR_doctrine_effort_desc:0 "The military doctrines that defined ground combat in the Great War are outdated. We must put our greatest minds to the task of shaping the military thought of tomorrow."
 TUR_equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "We will continue our efforts to ensure our infantry and support troops are armed with the best possible equipment of our time."
 TUR_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "The battlefield has changed not just in the interbellum years, but over the course of recent conflicts. We must continuously reevaluate our doctrines to reflect this."
 TUR_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "Instead of imitating or buying foreign equipment, we should aim to become world-leading in infantry weapons."
 TUR_armor_effort_desc:0 "Applying what we have learned from mechanizing our infantry, we can improve our armored vehicles as well."
 TUR_special_forces_desc:0 "We have need of elite forces; mountain troops and paratroopers should be our priority."
 TUR_aviation_effort_desc:0 "Nowhere is technological advances more rapid than in aerial warfare. Aviation is a field any modern nation must master."
 TUR_fighter_focus_desc:0 "We have not seen that last of dogfights in the Great War. Keeping ahead in the development of fighter planes will give us an edge in the future."
 TUR_bomber_focus_desc:0 "When people of the future speak of the horror to today's wars, fire raining from the skies will prominently feature. We will do our best to ensure those stories are told by our enemies."
 TUR_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Further advances in aviation will be necessary to integrate our air force well with other branches of the military."
 TUR_CAS_effort_desc:0 "A modern army needs support from vehicles not only on the ground, but also in the air."
 TUR_NAV_effort_desc:0 "Just as the new naval warfare takes place in part beneath the water's surface, part of it takes place in the air above the waters."
 TUR_naval_effort_desc:0 "The expansion of our navy should be our first priority. Assign all available resources to new Dockyards and research into light surface ships."
 TUR_flexible_navy_desc:0 "Reinventing naval warfare to account for the advances in submarine technology will allow us to strike efficiently against enemy convoys."
 TUR_large_navy_desc:0 "Adapting our naval doctrines to accommodate large ships and ensuring the safety of our trade convoys will teach us much about what sort of ships we need."
 TUR_submarine_effort_desc:0 "Submarine warfare is the most exciting naval development since the invention of the torpedo boat. We would do well to not just protect against submarines, but also use them against enemy shipping."
 TUR_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Before making forays into advanced battleship research, the smaller cruisers are in need of replacement."
 TUR_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "Studying the design and strategic use of submarines, we have also learned how to counter those strategies. Destroyers will be crucial for this."
 TUR_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "The nation with the most battleships will rule the oceans. Battleships and carriers represent the old and the new in naval superiority."
 TUR_industrial_effort_desc:0 "Focus all our political efforts on building up the civilian industry in a great leap forward."
 TUR_construction_effort_desc:0 "Civilian industrial capacity must not be underestimated even when war looms over the world."
 TUR_production_effort_desc:0 "If you can build tractors, you can build tanks! We must not allow our military production capacity to lag behind."
 TUR_construction_effort_2_desc:0 "Continuing to expand our factories will allow us to speed up production of goods for trade and further construction efforts."
 TUR_production_effort_2_desc:0 "Trying to adapt civilian factories to produce military equipment is inefficient. We should focus on preparing military production now."
 TUR_infrastructure_effort_desc:0 "A country without proper infrastructure cannot pursue advanced projects or constructions."
 TUR_production_effort_3_desc:0 "Continued efforts to expand our military factories are necessary to meet the demands for new equipment."
 TUR_infrastructure_effort_2_desc:0 "Extending our infrastructure further will enable the transports and communications necessary for high-tech clandestine projects."
 TUR_construction_effort_3_desc:0 "With our new infrastructural network, we have new opportunities for manufacturing."
 TUR_extra_tech_slot_desc:0 "Our industrial expansion and other recent advances might allow us to conduct more R&D in parallel."
 TUR_extra_tech_slot_2_desc:0 "The rapid industrialization of our nation has opened up new opportunities in R&D that we should pursue."
