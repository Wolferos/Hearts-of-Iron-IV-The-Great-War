 # [mexico] Political Effort
 #=========================================================================
 mex_political_effort:0 "Political Effort" #link me pls
 mex_political_effort_desc:0 "The time for reform is now. While the nation has been fine under the guidance of the system of old for years, these turbulent times require a government that is in position to respond to them. Whether we choose to change our ways as a nation, or bolster our existing government to stand up to new external threats, political change can do nothing but benefit our nation and people's future."

 mex_ww1_sovereignist_ethos:0 "Support Madero's democracy"
 mex_ww1_sovereignist_ethos_desc:0 "The authority of the state has been too split for too long. By reducing the powers of our substates compared to our central government, we will overcome regionalism and factionalism to make a stronger nation, which will inevitably open the door to enact further measures."

 mex_ww1_Support_the_democracy:0 "Support the Democracy"
 mex_ww1_Support_the_democracy_desc:0 "It is said that any ruler, at their core, derives their power from the people. If we make a move towards a more democratic society, even if we don't become one ourselves, we can at the very least fall into a much nicer position to trade with the various democratic nations around the world."

 mex_ww1_centralizedpower:0 "Labor Program"
 mex_ww1_centralizedpower_desc:0 "In a time of war, or those immediately before or after, everyone has a job to do for their nation. If we put drifters, the homeless, and all of the other moochers who can't get a job to work on building for us, we can establish new manufacturies for nearly no cost, and the factory can even hire from the same labor pool if need be."

 mex_ww1_freespeech:0 "Free Speech"
 mex_ww1_freespeech_desc:0 "By giving the people the right to free speech and demonstration, we ensure that, at the very least, people can get their anger and stances out in a more creative way. Anybody who shouts ''FIRE!'' in a crowded movie theater, or uses any explitive to describe the Head of State's mother, is still going to prison."

 mex_ww1_reorganization_act:0 "Reorganization Act"
 mex_ww1_reorganization_act_desc:0 "Much of our territory has been under the possession of various groups and individuals since civilization came to our humble nation. Over hundreds of years, however, much of this territory has been inefficiently laid out or used. By reorganizing the land and owners of our nation, particularly those that have been dormant, we can squeeze some of the newly displaced people into our factories."

 mex_ww1_full_rearmament:0 "Harsh Rationing"
 mex_ww1_full_rearmament_desc:0 "With our brave heroes actively defending the nation, they should have top priority for food and materials! Of course, the civilian population may resort to literally counting their beans and we might have a more restless population on our hands because of it, but if nothing else, our boys in uniform won't go hungry anytime soon."

 Mex_collectivist_ethos:0 "Supporting Other Revolutionary Leaders" #link me pls
 Mex_collectivist_ethos_desc:0 "The old state is doomed to fall, taking our country with it unless we are to take extreme measures.

 Mex_nationalism_focus:0 "Support Pancho Villa"
 Mex_nationalism_focus_desc:0 "National pride for our great home country is swelling thanks to recent events.

This military culture we are establishing is only furthering the cause of our armed forces."

mex_military_youth:0 "Military Youth"
mex_military_youth_desc:0 "Our militaristic culture must even be present with the children! By drilling respect for the military, and even offering training to the younger generations, we can ensure that they grow up to enlist to serve our glorious regime. Some might call this exploitation, but it sounds better when you say you're giving teenagers a bright future."

mex_paramilitarism:0 "Paramilitarism"
mex_paramilitarism_desc:0 "Some nations are foolish enough to condemn armed civilian groups, for fear of rebellion. However, if we are careful to restrict these ad-hoc militias to loyalists to the regime, we can create yet another group of angry men with guns who support our nation, which could do us well in case of war."

mex_internationalism_focus:0 "Support Emiliano Zapata"
mex_internationalism_focus_desc:0 "The Communist Revolution cannot be stopped. It is better that our people embrace it and embrace it now, than have a civil war for it later. Once we openly begin our support for the Internationalist Communist Movement, we shall become as red as the blood of man."

mex_political_correctness:0 "Political Correctness"
mex_political_correctness_desc:0 "Anyone who speaks out against our movement is clearly doing it as a hate crime towards the people we support with it. Therefore, anyone who speaks out the regime is to be closely watched, and, perhaps, unpersoned."

mex_indoctrination_focus:0 "Indoctrination"
mex_indoctrination_focus_desc:0 "After many years of debate on how to get rowdy anti-communist citizens to finally support our wonderful new regime, some of the men on the Worker's Council suggested the establishment of a new ''Ministry of Love'', which, officially, humanely persuades people to understand why they should support our government. We don't talk about what happens unofficially in there."

mex_political_commissars:0 "Political Commissars"
mex_political_commissars_desc:0 "The military, ironically, is a place where anti-communist support thrives. By ensuring that our loving government has eyes everywhere, we can root out the dissent from these groups before it can rise."

mex_ww1_fortify_coast_desc:0 "A coastline is not an easy thing to defend. With ships able to land troops nearly anywhere coastal in our nation, Coastal Forts, which can help against marine invasions, are no difficult building to construct, and will help throw our enemies back into the ocean from whence they came."

mex_ww1_oppression_minorities:0 "Oppress Minorities"
mex_ww1_oppression_minorities_desc:0 "The best way to ensure loyalty from minority groups is to make them avoid identifying with each other. By making publications in other languages illegal, punishing citizens who fail to confirm to our culture, and enforcing local inferiority, we can fool some into thinking they are one of us, and keep the others from speaking out against us."

mex_ww1_Unify_all_indigenous_languages:0 "Unify all the indigenous people"

mex_ww1_diplomatic_effort_desc:0 "It is becoming increasingly difficult to stay in the middle of the affairs in the world as it stands. Our diplomatic corps is already asking if we're to be involved in the coming power struggle, or if we are to stay out of things entirely. While we can't answer that question quite yet, we can easily expand our corps to be able to choose one of these options."

mex_ww1_takeposition:0 "Take Position"
mex_ww1_takeposition_desc:0 "Our place in the world is tenuous at best. After all, with the great empires at each others' throats, what's to stop one from turning on us once they're through?

mex_ww1_supportgermany:0 "Support Germany"
mex_ww1_supportgermany_desc:0 "With the German Empire's massive industrial sector, they seem to be the clear-cut bet, even if they are diplomatically isolated. Showing public support to the Germans on even a few, non-key matters will send a message that we're moving closer to the Central Powers."

mex_ww1_supportfrance:0 "Support France"

mex_ww1_supportaustria_desc:0 "The old empire of Austria-Hungary has lived to see the rise of most of the major nations on the world map. So, surely, if we want to become seen as a more major nation, what better country to support? This will also help us draw closer to the Central Powers."

mex_ww1_supportrussia:0 "Support Russia"
mex_ww1_supportrussia_desc:0 "The Russian Empire is in pretty dire need of international help.

mex_ww1_joingermany:0 "Join Central Powers"
