# [GERMAN EMPIRE] Interwar
#=========================================================================
GER_interwar_beer_hall_putsch:0 "Beer Hall Putsch"
GER_interwar_beer_hall_putsch_desc:0 "Hitler has become the leader of the National Socialist party, and is stirring up trouble in Munich. Getting rid of him would be great for the stability of the Weimar Republic. Giving him a good opportunity to shoot off and try a coup may give us the opportunity to get rid of him. Of course, we DO run the risk of his success..."

GER_interwar_mein_kampf:0 "Mein Kampf"
GER_interwar_mein_kampf_desc:0 "Hitler's time in prison has given him the opportunity to write a long book about his life and ideology. Allowing its publication and spread may calm the growing movement. And hopefully not keep spreading it."

GER_interwar_hitler_chancellor:0 "Name Hitler Chancellor of Germany"
GER_interwar_hitler_chancellor_desc:0 "Chancellor von Papen has advised President Hindenburg to give Hitler his post. So long as the President was alive and able to keep his power, Hitler shouldn't be able to exercize true control, and will burn himself out. Yet, this is a serious risk...but may avert Civil War."

GER_interwar_night_long_knives:0 "Night of the Long Knives"
GER_interwar_night_long_knives_desc:0 "Now that the new Reich has taken over, the old enemies must be purged. Anyone who could potentially ever even be against the Reich must be purged- and quickly!"
