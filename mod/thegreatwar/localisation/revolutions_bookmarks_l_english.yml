  1914_NAME:0 "The Great War"
  1914_DESC:0 "Contradictions between the great powers: Germany, France, Great Britain, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Turkey, Italy - have been developing and exacerbated for many years. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 recorded a new balance of power in Europe, which did not suit everyone. For the years that have passed since that war, there has been a sharp rise in the productive forces throughout the world. Especially in the US and Japan. A new big war is inevitable."
  FRA_1914_DESC:0 "The future German Empire dealt a heavy defeat to France in 1871. The Germans occupied our ancestral territories - Alsace and Lorraine. France has learned the lessons of that war, and now our army is strong, like never before. Revenge is near!"
  USA_1914_DESC:0 "After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, the United States of America has made great strides in many areas. We have a strong economy and a lot of natural resources. However, Europe is brewing war, and the situation on the border with Mexico is unstable. How long can America remain neutral?"
  ENG_1914_DESC:0 "The British Empire is at the peak of its power. Over our empire, the sun never sets. Britain is the mistress of the seas. But Germany is rapidly increasing its military power and political influence in the world. Should we accept the challenge?"
  GER_1914_DESC:0 "Germany is the youngest and dynamically developing colonial empire. We later joined the colonial race, and countries such as Britain, France, Belgium, Holland and Portugal do everything to prevent us from taking a worthy place in. Russia also entered into an alliance with the British and French, and now represents a serious threat to our power.\n\nHow long can this be tolerated ?!"
  RUS_1914_DESC:0 "Russia has already recovered from defeat in the war with Japan, and from the consequences of the bloody revolution of 1905-07. We made advantageous alliances with France and our former enemy, Great Britain. Now, when Turkistan is safe, we can begin to fulfill our old tasks. We will free the Slavs in Europe. We will clean Constantinople from the Turks. We will no longer allow every rabble under the red banner to shake our millennial power."
  AUS_1914_DESC:0 "The dualistic Austro-Hungarian monarchy is the largest state in Europe. The Emperor Franz Joseph has more than fifty million subjects, twenty nationalities. Just like Russia, we want peace in the Balkans. Austria-Hungary should unite the disunited southern Slavic states under the rule of the Habsburgs."
  TUR_1914_DESC:0 "The entire 19th century, the Ottoman Empire lost land both in the Balkans and in the Caucasus. Italy defeated us in North Africa. If Russia, in alliance with Great Britain and France, continues to grow stronger, then we will lose our main strategic trump card - the Black Sea straits. We need to use any chance to take revenge. Otherwise, the disintegration of the state will continue."
  ITA_1914_DESC:0 "Italy is a welcome ally for all European powers. Now we are in alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. However, at any time we can go over to the side of the Entente. It is necessary to make the right choice."
  JAP_1914_DESC:0 "Combining the latest world technology with old traditions, Japan has become a leading power in the Pacific. Russia has already been defeated, what steps should we take next?"
