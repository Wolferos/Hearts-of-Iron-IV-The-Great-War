 AUH_ww1_Multinational_State_desc:0 "Unlike most countries of this period, the Austro-Hungarian Empire is not a nationalistically-organized state, but instead a relic of old marriages and throne inheritances, which have given the empire a cultural patchwork of territories. In recent times, many of the subject nationalities of the Empire have begun a push for independence, hurting the Austrian state."

 ITA_ww1_Risorgimento_desc:0 "Risorgimento (also known as the Italian Unification) was the political and social movement that consolidated different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of the Kingdom of Italy. The memory of this event, as well as the Irridentism that followed, is a driving force in both Italian unity and politics."

 ww1_Faith_Allah_desc:0 "In the Qur’an, Allah commands believers to be united, to join ranks in faith, to regard and love one another as brothers, to be forgiving and protective and to strongly avoid fragmentation, division and dispersal. Ottoman hegemony in Mecca, as well as the Sultan's title as the Caliph os Islam, proves their government's faith."

 ww1_Scramble_for_Africa:0 "Scramble for Africa"
 ww1_Scramble_for_Africa_desc:0 "The rivalry between Britain, France, Germany, and the other European powers accounts for much of the tension between the Great Powers in this era. With only fragments of territory left unclaimed, the demands of annexing foreign colonies are already starting to echo in our streets."

 AUH_ww1_House_Habsburg_Lorraine_desc:0 "The House of Habsburg-Lorraine is one of the most influential Royal Houses of Europe, and the ruling dynasty of Austria-Hungary. The long legacy of this family on the throne of the Empire gives them much of the necessary legitimacy to maintain their rule, so long as they can maintain it."

 GER_ww1_North_German_Confederation_desc:0 "After years of being the secondary player in the German sphere, Prussia formed the North German Confederation, establishing itself as the foremost power in Germany, before finally unifying the empire.

 German_staff_ww1:0 "German Staff"
 German_staff_ww1_desc:0 "The German Army, responsible for the continuous study of all aspects of war, and for drawing up and reviewing plans for mobilization or campaign. It existed unofficially from 1806, and was formally established by law in 1814, the first general staff in existence. It was distinguished by the formal selection of its officers by intelligence and proven merit rather than patronage or wealth, and by the exhaustive and rigorously structured training which its staff officers undertook. Its rise and development gave the German armed forces a decisive strategic advantage over their adversaries for nearly a century and a half."
 Austrian_staff:0 "Austrian Staff"
 Austrian_staff_desc:0 "The Imperial and Royal General Staff of Austria-Hungary was part of the Ministry of War. It was headed by the Chief of the General Staff for the Whole Armed Forces, who had direct access to the Emperor. The general staff was responsible for planning and preparations, while the Armeeoberkommando (AOK) was the operational high command. In fact, since the AOK was under the direct command of the emperor and the chief of the general staff was his chief adviser, in practice the AOK was under the control of the chief of the general staff."
 Franch_Staff:0 "French Staff"
 Franch_Staff_desc:0 "In times of war, the army chief of staff took charge of general headquarters (GQG: Grand Quartier Général). During the First World War, the leader of the French armies was variously referred to as supreme general (generalissimo) or commander-in-chief. In the closing years of the war, the establishment of the Supreme War Council in 1917 led to overall command being held by French general Ferdinand Foch, and by mid-1918 French army chief Pétain was subordinate to Foch. Although the war essentially ended with the armistice in November 1918, the war-time organisation persisted until 1920."
 ENG_Staff:0 "English Staff"
 ENG_Staff_desc:0 "The British Army during World War I could trace its organisation to the increasing demands of imperial expansion. The framework was the voluntary system of recruitment and the regimental system, which had been defined by the Cardwell and Childers Reforms of the late 19th century. The British Army had been prepared and primarily called upon for Empire matters and the ensuing colonial wars.[4] In the last years of the 19th century, the Army was involved in a major conflict, the Second Boer War (1899-1902), which highlighted shortcomings in its tactics, leadership and administration.

 POL_interwar_spirit_WielkopolskaUprising_desc:0 "With the Second Republic only months old, few accept the idea of losing sovereignty once again. While Poland was looking west to avoid a vengeful Germany, however, Lenin broke his promise declaring the Polish Partition null and began to push in from the east. This has only inflamed the fighting spirit of the Polish people to defend the young nation to the last from the Red invaders."

 GER_interwar_spirit_BannedConscription:0 "Heavy Military Restrictions"
 GER_interwar_spirit_BannedConscription_desc:0 "With only 100,000 volunteers (and no conscripts) allowed in the army, no submarines or planes, only a few battleships allowed, and even restrictions on small arms, the Treaty of Versailles is a blatant attempt to ensure Germany's military is among the smallest in Europe. The faster the new German government can get around these setbacks- whether by diplomacy, creative bureaucracy, or shadier measures- the faster the nation will be a power once again."

 SOV_interwar_spirit_LeninRedArmy:0 "The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army"
 SOV_interwar_spirit_LeninRedArmy_desc:0 "With fronts all throughout the former Empire against White armies, foreign invasions, and reactionary local governments alike, the Red Army by its nature is mostly made up of untrained or partially trained militia, though the meat of the force is the smaller force of better trained and equipped regulars. This allows Soviet Russia to field a huge army to defend its borders, although plagued by organizational issues and holding only a few divisions truly suited to attack."

 interwar_spirit_TheGreatWar_Winner_desc:0 "All questions of the nature and justification of the war aside, this nation was one of those represented by the winning delegation at the Treaty of Versailles, something few will complain about. Now the people of the nation seek a return to peace. Though pleased enough revolution is mostly out of the question, the desires of the public are mostly disarmament, diplomacy, and a focus on economic growth."

 interwar_spirit_TGWWinner_Italy:0 "Jubilation of Victory?"
 interwar_spirit_TGWWinner_Italy_desc:0 "Though few in Italy are complaining about being on the winning side during the Great War, many are complaining about the rather meager compensation Italy ended up with for so many lost- in fact, to the point where even now, anger with the government and former allies as well as political extremism are approaching the same levels as they have in the defeated Central Powers. If this is not tamed, Italy may join the powers seeking revenge."
 #--------------------------------------------------------------
 interwar_spirit_TheGreatWar_Loser:0 "Shame of Defeat"
 interwar_spirit_TheGreatWar_Loser_desc:0 "The order of the day in this nation is finger pointing between civic and military officials and wide-scale public dissent from the civilian population. Incensed by the humiliating treaties to end the war and the heavy burdens placed on the nation's military and economy, this nation is a hotbed for radicals who seek to overthrow the old order, avenge the loss, and lead the state back to glory. Simply put, the people want to end the sting of the shame of defeat."
