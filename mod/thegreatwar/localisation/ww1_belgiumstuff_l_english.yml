Focusing our production and designers on this specific class of aircraft would be a good way to ensure that we can use the Air Force as a ground support tool, able to help the infantry gain ground by destroying enemy defenses and positions. Of course, fighters should still be produced, but these bombers may win us the war."

However, with more and more machines in the sky, it's clear that this is no longer the most viable way to engage in air combat. Some of our physicists may be valuable in helping us to determine new formations for our pilots to use."
 BEL_ww1_pilotformation_2:0 "Pilot Formation II"
 BEL_ww1_pilotformation_2_desc:0 "The new formations we have established have indeed been a boon to us in combat. However, ensuring people stick to the formations is a different story entirely. Encouraging our top aces to put out a manual for our pilots on air tactics and formation will ensure our pilots stick to doing what's best- and perhaps, these sorts of writings will help spread new tricks and doctrines."
 BEL_ww1_aircraftprod_1:0 "Aircraft Production"
 BEL_ww1_aircraftprod_1_desc:0 "Though Engineers have been making aircraft for us loyally, it is simply time to introduce factories outright to the concept. Putting planes into mass production will help us flood the sky with friendly craft- and, more importantly, help us deprive our enemies of the same advantage. Who knows? Maybe some of these factory engineers may have some good ideas for aircraft designs..."
 BEL_ww1_aircraftprod_2:0 "Aircraft Production II"
 BEL_ww1_aircraftprod_2_desc:0 "While Aircraft have been produced at factories dedicated to vehicle production, specific manufacturies dedicated specifically to planes themselves have been established.

 BEL_ww1_airbomb_1:0 "Air Bombing Effort"
 BEL_ww1_airbomb_1_desc:0 "While the tactics of our fighters are improving with formations, our bombers are still very basic machines with very basic doctrines. Some of our old airship bombers possess now essentially unused expertise, which could help the latter as time solves the former. By utilizing these men, we can ensure that the old lessons of bombing are not lost on newer craft."
 BEL_ww1_airbomb_2:0 "Air Bombing Effort II"
 BEL_ww1_airbomb_2_desc:0 "One of the biggest issues with our air force currently is the fact that bombing is, for the most part, a guessing game, with the required geometrical calculations simply not viable methods mid-flight. With not just doctrine, but also standardized equipment and training for its use, we can turn bombing from a mildly threatening game of chance to a precise and deadly science." 
 BEL_ww1_air_innovation:0 "Air Innovation Focus"
 BEL_ww1_air_innovation_desc:0 "All of the recent developments to air warfare, both in theory and in practice, have given birth to a golden age of aircraft development.

Perhaps one day, Aircraft may be the most important weapon in war...nah, probably not." 
 BEL_ww1_navalair:0 "Naval Bombing Effort"

 BEL_ww1_large_navy_desc:0 "Having just Battleships and Dreadnoughts would be formidible on its own, but also creating a solid core of screens and battlecruisers can easily tip the seas in our favor from both the tactical options such crafts give us, as well as sheer number. If we build around this concept and study the doctrine to match, our fleet may just become unbeatable."
 BEL_ww1_navyreform:0 "Navy Deployment"
 BEL_ww1_navyreform_desc:0 "It is not simply guns and ships that win a naval battle. The best vessel in the world is no good if it's not on the sea at the right time and at the right place. Investing in more direct communication channels both ship-to-ship and ship-to-port can help us ensure that a ship will be at precisely the right place at precisely the right time, assisting in our attempts at naval supremacy." 
 BEL_ww1_cruiser_effort:0 "Cruiser Effort"
 BEL_ww1_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Our admirals desire a larger amount and investment in Cruisers, to give us medium-sized ships good for harassing smaller vessels, enemy cargo ships, and supporting larger warships. Sending out for shipwrights to propose and build advanced designs of this ship class will help us against any enemy with a large, Destroyer-focused fleet, and help our Submarines stay out of danger."
 BEL_ww1_destroyer_effort:0 "Destroyer Effort"
 BEL_ww1_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "Our admirals have requested a larger amount and investment in Destroyers, to give us light ships good for taking out submarines, scouting for the rest of the fleet, and escorting Convoys. Ordering more and better Destroyers in our dockyards will help us keep our trade routes open, and Submarines well out and away." 
 BEL_ww1_capital_ships_effort:0 "Capital Ship Effort"
 BEL_ww1_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "Our admirals have given a simple demand: More of these amazing Dreadnoughts, and bigger and better ones as well. Constructing these behemoth ships will help us take control of the waters, give fire support to troops fighting on the shores, and protect our naval invasions to start with. "
 BEL_ww1_carrier_focus:0 "Carrier Focus"
 BEL_ww1_carrier_focus_desc:0 "A few radical minds have proposed a nearly unarmed ship, simply used for hosting an array of naval bombers. This is a very promising project, even if it is a bit hindered by the technology of today. If we are to pursue this project, perhaps planes will one day become a common sight even over the waters." 
 BEL_ww1_antisubmarine:0 "Anti-Submarine Warfare"
 BEL_ww1_antisubmarine_desc:0 "Submarines are a tricky vessel to catch, particularly when well-commandeered. If we don't intend to let all of our incoming cargo ships sink to the bottom of the ocean, our admirals have advised us to begin investing in depth charges, advanced torpedos, and other weapons that might be able to take out the unseen menace."
