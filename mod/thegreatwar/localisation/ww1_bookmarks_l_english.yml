 # 1910

 POWDERKEG_NAME:0 "The Powderkeg of Europe"
 POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "1910 is a challenging time for the peace in Europe. The Italians are preparing for a war with the Ottomans, which will threaten their hold in the Balkans. Rebellion in Morocco is beginning to boil over, much to the anguish of France and to the delight of the German Empire. All in all, either clear heads will be needed to keep the peace, or strong hearts to win the war."

 FRA_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "In 1870, France was dealt a blow by the forming German Empire in a crushing war which saw the loss of Alsace-Lorraine. This made an implacable enemy of France, who has been licking her wounds since. Though the territory is German-speaking, the French people simply will not let this humiliation stand. \n\nFortunately, French diplomacy has built an Entente Cordial with the United Kingdom and Russia. When war breaks out, surely the Germans will crumble. The matter is, of course, ''when''."

 USA_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "While Europe trudges closer and closer to war and misery, peace and prosperity is the way in the United States in 1910. The success of Dollar Diplomacy and the Roosevelt Corollary have finally secured Latin America from European powers once and for all. The Philippines have been pacified for good. \n\nIt'd be foolish to be blind to Europe, but for now, America is safe to build up."

 ENG_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "The British Empire is still at its zenith. Controlling a massive amount of territory in Africa, Asia, and the Americas through both direct rule and dominions, the United Kingdom still has one continent yet to be mastered: Europe. The United Kingdom has a few allies on the mainland, but none they are particularly fond of. \n\nOf course, good king Edward is surely not long for this world, and crown prince George has time to shake things up. What will the next king do for Britannia's place in Europe?"

 GER_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "What was once 35 different independent nations is now the German Empire, seen by many as one of the world's foremost powers, if not the strongest of them all. However, there are many who would trifle with such a state. The German enemy of France has formed the Triple Entente of themselves, the UK, and Russia, all far stronger than Germany's own weak allies. \n\nWith just old Austria and disloyal Italy, Germany needs either more friends or more power to survive the coming times."

 ITA_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Italy is  the smallest third of the Triple Alliance, an alliance with which she has little faith in. Austria-Hungary, Italy's natural rival, is now a friend in the world of treaties but still a rival in practical terms. After all, Italian Irredentism still decrees the Austrian-held Dalmatian coast as Italian. For now, however, there are more pressing matters. \n\nWar plans with the Ottoman Turks are already being drawn up. The government predicts a short, decisive war. Italy shall prove her power."

 AUH_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "The last century was a curse to the Austrian throne. Humiliation after humiliation was thrust upon her, from the rampage of Napoleon to the unification of Germany by the Prussians. Venerable old Kaiser Franz Josef now stands as the weakest member of the Triple Alliance, with two of her old enemies. But surprisingly, this has gone well for Austria so far. \n\nThe Hapsburgs have inherited Bosnia, and the people of Hungary finally seem placated. Perhaps more good shall come."

 RUS_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Recent years have not been kind to the Russian Empire. With a major military defeat at the hands of Japan, followed by a revolution that forced the once-invincible Tsar into a constitution, the Russian government must get back on its feet and prove its strength again, or risk revolution. \n\nLuckily, the Balkans are turbulent again. The crumbling Ottoman Empire is Russia's opportunity to expand, create new puppet states, and more importantly, prove it is still a world power."

 TUR_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Storm clouds are gathering over Kostantiniyye. Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria have been scheming together again- likely a war to try and claim the territory they unrightfully claim is theirs. The Albanians are close to revolt. The Italian government is also very publicly contemplating a conquest of the Tripoli Vilayet. \n\nLoss of territory is nearly inevitable. Ottoman Diplomacy, therefore, should center around ensuring we keep the capital, if nothing else."

 SER_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Serbia is seen by outsiders as a backwater, minor nation. Nothing more than a pawn in a great game that the world's empires are playing as each other. Of course, the empires of the world may learn sooner than they think that the Serbs are destined for greater things. \n\nCurrently, most Serbs live outside our borders, in Turkish or Austrian territory. If we are to make a deal with the devil- the Bulgarians- the Serbs may begin their road for glory by way of full Serbian unification."

 BUL_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Bulgaria has already made a name for itself through successful conflicts against the Serbs and outmaneuvering the Ottoman Empire to unify with Eastern Rumelia. Of course, now the state stands at a more uncomfortable position. The Turks seem unwilling to put up any more Bulgarian territory for grabs, and the Russians are slowly withdrawing their support. \n\nPerhaps it is not too late to mend fences with Serbia? After all, a Bulgaria with strong friends could be a surprising menace."

 MEX_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "The Mexico of 1910 is a strange case indeed. The Porfiriato has been a great boon to Mexico since 1876, but now that the heat has been turned up, it seems President Diaz's time may be limited. Of course, the Government sees this as biting the hand. \n\nFrancisco Madero is actively and obviously plotting against the Diaz government. If he finds himself ambitious enough, he may see Mexico in his own back pocket yet."

 JAP_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "In just under 50 years, Japan has turned from a backwards despotate ruled by a Shogun to a proper modern Empire, just as powerful as any country Europe has to offer. Emperor Meiji is to thank for it, but sadly he is both old and diseased- and can't possibly live much longer. \n\nBefore Crown Prince Yoshihito takes the crown, there are a few more matters to settle, however. The elderly emperor must decide where Japan stands with Russia, and what to do with the Korean vassal."

 # 1914

 SCHLIEFFEN_NAME:0 "The Great War"
 SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The drums of war are beating fervently. In the next year, a war is expected to break out between, at the very least, France and Russia vs. Germany and Austria-Hungary. If more powers end up getting involved, the conflict could be the largest war the world's ever seen. One thing is certain: For many countries, their very existence is on the line."

 FRA_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "France's revanche is soon at hand. The return of the Tricolor to Alsace-Lorraine and the rightful French territory owned by the Germans in Africa, seems nearer than ever. Of course, the Germans are just as ready to strike, but France's time to prove a lesson learned is now. \n\nAfter all, surely all that will be needed is the French Élan that was missing from the last war, and the Germans will be sent packing. Of course, there's rumors a long war could be to our disadvantage, but rumors aren't always true, are they?"

 USA_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The United States is an isolated, pacifist country, as it has been since Theodore Roosevelt's administration. However, the climate of the world today leaves little room for a nation with America's power to stay out of these affairs. Though Wilson has ran a campaign on isolationism, and seems to have little incentive to change course, the spirit of the Great War could easily force the U.S.A.'s hand. \n\n With Mexico unstable and Europe at each others' throats, how long can the U.S. rise above the fight?"

 ENG_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The situation in Europe has become too much to bear. Germany and France are both far too close to Britain's position for the comfort of the British public. The Kaiser even has the gall to challenge the Royal Navy's dominance. When the war all fear is to come, something simply must be done. Or must it? \n\nThere is the option to let France and Germany grind each other down and build ourselves up. Of course, British troops MUST get involved if Germany- or France, perhaps- end up attacking any British allies..."

 GER_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Herr von Bismarck's prediction that the next war will start with a spark from the powder keg of the Balkans seems to be furbther and further approaching reality. With all of the tension stemming from the region, there's no doubt a war between German and French alliances will break out soon. Germany, therefore, must be prepared. \n\nThe time for diplomacy is over. The German Army must be readied for what could be a long, gruesome, and, worst of all, two-front war."

 ITA_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "22 years ago, Italy halfheartedly joined the Triple Alliance with Germany and the hated Austrians to spite France's gains in Tunisia. Today, the alliance is the most shaky in Europe. With her old alliance, Italy has the chance to get Savoy, Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia for herself. However, the Entente would provide the Dalmatian coast- and seems much more able to do so. \n\nItaly still has time before the war to make a decision. But on which side does her fate lay?"

 AUH_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Austria-Hungary is a resilient state, and has survived much hardship where other states would be destroyed. Yet, the increasing support for Panslavism in Russia combined with the fervor for war in the Balkans poses a threat that may very well spell the end of the Hapsburg rule. Worse yet, the rivalry with the Italians has started again in earnest. \n\nAustria must quell the fury of the Balkan states and stand with Germany against her enemies, or the Empire may become just a cherished memory."

 RUS_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The Balkan Wars did little to calm the people of the Russian Empire. Though Russia had thrown their support behind the South Slavic powers, only Serbia and Montenegro are loyal to the empire of the east, and crisis is on the horizon if things don't change- and now. Serbian extremists have proposed trying to break a war out with Austria-Hungary, and this is exactly what Russia needs. \n\nThe clear goals of German Poland and the Slavic lands in Austria are in Russia's sights."

 TUR_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "What was once the world's greatest empire has now fallen to near ruin. The Sultanate is no longer considered a major power in Europe, and the carving of Turkey between all of the European powers is a constant threat that crawls closer and closer to reality. To make matters worse, the incompetent Enver Pasha has seized effective control of the government. \n\nThe best course of action, according to the Porte, is to draw close to Germany, and hope their mighty army can protect us in our time of need."

 SER_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The Balkan Wars saw a massive success for Serbia, as well as their most important ally in Greece. The hard part, however has just begun: The Habsburgs still hold the region of Bosnia, as well as other South Slavic territories. Worse yet, they see Serbia as a troublemaker, and would be more than happy to rid the world of the state at a moment's notice. \n\nFortunately, Russia seems to have taken a liking to Serbia, though perhaps for malicious reasons. If Tsar Peter utilizes this, the world may change forever..."

 BUL_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Bulgaria was wrong to trust the Greeks and the Romanians to stay out of the inevitable conflict between themselves and Serbia, and are down to the lowest territorial extent since independence from the Ottoman Empire. It is unlikely they will be fooled twice. Russia seems next in the line of false friends, seeking only to profit from the state. \n\nThe only countries that seem to genuinely have Bulgaria's best interests at heart are Germany and Austria. Perhaps it's time for a new alliance?"

 MEX_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "While initially it seemed Madero's victory in the first phase of the Mexican Civil War was the end of it, in 1913 he was deposed, killed, and replaced by one of his former generals, Victoriano Huerta. Huerta is not popular or terribly competent, and few see him lasting long in command of the nation. \n\nStill, there is no agreement among the Mexican populace as to who is to be the next leader. Some rally behind causes as extreme as Communism or Military Dictatorship. Will Civil War rear its ugly head again?"

 JAP_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Unfortunately, it turns out Emperor Taisho is cursed with mental afflictions which have severely impacted his ability to rule. Fortunately for Japan, his ministers and other members of the Imperial court have begun to administrate Japan, whose public is getting its first taste of liberty. \n\nBut still, what of the war in Europe? Would it be to Japan's benefit to throw in? After all, the British-Japanese alliance is tenuous at best, and Japan may be better off simply waiting to choose which side will serve its interests."
