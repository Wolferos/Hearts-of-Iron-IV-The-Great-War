JAP_ww1_defense_border_desc:0 "Japan is an island nation, which carries benefits and risks. The most dire risk being anyone who lands too close to the capital could simply oust our government, and our low landmass means that a few divisions may secure giant portions of our territory quickly. Japan must be unassailable, or it will not survive."

JAP_ww1_Japan_Korea_Treaty_desc:0 "Korea has been long a puppet state of our empire, but it would serve better as territory. If we force the puppet Emperor into an annexation agreement, we can knock it off the map in a fashion just seemingly diplomatic enough to keep Europe and the Americans off of our backs, which will establish our first territory on the Asian mainland."

JAP_ww1_Japanese_Expansionism:0 "Japanese Expansionism"
JAP_ww1_Japanese_Expansionism_desc:0 "The most logical solution to Japan's issues of low amounts of natural resources and tenuous defensive position is simply to expand outwards. If we expand onto the Asian mainland and farther out into the Pacific, we will control the supplies we need, and the outposts we deserve."

JAP_ww1_War_in_Europe_Opportunity:0 "War in Europe Opportunity"
JAP_ww1_War_in_Europe_Opportunity_desc:0 "The war in Europe is a grand opportunity for Japan! Though we are a nominal British ally, we could choose to join either side. Logically, the best thing to do would be to join the winning side, and profit from the spoils."

JAP_ww1_Pro_German:0 "Pro-German Policy"

JAP_ww1_Pro_British:0 "Pro-British Policy"
JAP_ww1_Pro_British_desc:0 "The British are technically allied to us, and were one of the few European nations to invest heavily in Japan's navy. Siding with them will, if nothing else, ensure we never have to face the fearsome Royal Navy until we're prepared."

JAP_ww1_Claims_on_Pacific_Islands:0 "Claim Pacific Islands"
JAP_ww1_Claims_on_Pacific_Islands_desc:0 "The Pacific Islands are the most logical place for Japan to expand. If we seize larger parts of the pacific, we can ensure anyone who seeks to attack Japan from the east has a long way to go. Laying down claim to these islands now could pay off at a future peace conference."

JAP_ww1_Join_Central_Power:0 "Join Central Powers"
JAP_ww1_Join_Central_Power_desc:0 "The weakness of the Entente, as well as easy and mostly defended targets in the east, have given Japan a grand opportunity to expand into the Pacific and Oceania. Joining the Central Powers will ensure a glorious Japanese empire for years to come!"

JAP_ww1_Invade_Singapore:0 "Invade Singapore"
JAP_ww1_Invade_Singapore_desc:0 "Singapore is a major British port in Asia, in position to allow them to continue control over Hong Kong, help keep the Pacific secured, and other unfortunate benefits. If we simply oust them from the area- perhaps from the rest of Malaya as well- we can ensure that their ships will have no safe port so close to Japan."

JAP_ww1_Siege_of_Tsingtao:0 "Siege of Tsingtao"
JAP_ww1_Siege_of_Tsingtao_desc:0 "Qingdao is one of Germany's most valuable, least protected colonies. Seizing the area now will ensure no Imperial ships raid our shores, and give Japan yet another solid territory on the Mainland of China."

JAP_ww1_Thirteen_Demands:0 "Thirteen Demands"
JAP_ww1_Thirteen_Demands_desc:0 "Though China would be in no position to resist Japan, the rest of the European powers as well as the United States are unified in threatening us with an embargo in the case of going too far with China. If we simply demand an inheiritance to the German economic sphere, we can expand our influence in China without damaging our position." 

JAP_ww1_Twenty_One_Demands:0 "Twenty-One Demands"
JAP_ww1_Twenty_One_Demands_desc:0 "Though the West may denounce us for it, China as a puppet state is a deal far too good to pass up. With their manpower and resources and our cunning and might, we would be an unstoppable force! Of course, if they reject our demands, we may have to either revise, or prepare for a war which would most certainly unify the dissenting powers..."

JAP_ww1_Appeasement_China:0 "Appeasement with China"
JAP_ww1_Appeasement_China_desc:0 "China is in a position to give a little, but it would be better for us both to walk out saving face. If we seek the route of mutual appeasement, we will continue our influence growth in China, without necessarily putting ourselves in any sort of diplomatic danger."

JAP_ww1_Pressure_China:0 "Pressure China"
JAP_ww1_Pressure_China_desc:0 "It is only a matter of time until Japan dominates East Asia. China is a crucial step to our brilliant master plan! If they do not acede to Japanese influence, perhaps the threat of gunboat diplomacy will get them closer in line...though this will create a dreadful crisis with the European powers."

JAP_ww1_South_Manchuria_Railway_Zone:0 "South Manchuria Railway Zone"
JAP_ww1_South_Manchuria_Railway_Zone_desc:0 "We have controlled the South Manchuria Railway since 1905. However, with China too tied up in its civil war to resist, we can easily expand precisely what it means to control the railways and what is southern Manchuria, until we have near full control of the region. And due to the war, it's unlikely they'd ever be able to resist."

JAP_ww1_Claim_Manchuria:0 "Claim Manchuria"
JAP_ww1_Claim_Manchuria_desc:0 "Now that the Manchurian Qing dynasty no longer exercizes effective control in China, we could garner a bit of local support for a Manchu government. This will nearly inevitably lead to conflict in war-torn China, but what could they possibly to do resist?"

JAP_ww1_siberian_intervention:0 "Siberian Intervention"
JAP_ww1_siberian_intervention_desc:0 "With the Russian Civil War in full progress, Japan must intervene in Siberia. Though the White Russians are no friends of ours, they make a far better neighbor than the Soviet Union. Besides, who knows what we might pick up from the expidition?"

JAP_ww1_Contest_Russian_Domination_desc:0 "The Russians hold themselves to be the Emperor of the East, the foremost authority in Eastern Asia. Have these fools forgotten already our last encounter?

JAP_ww1_Russian_Revolution_Opportunity:0 "Russian Revolution Opportunity"
