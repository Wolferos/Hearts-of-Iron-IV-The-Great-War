JAP_ww1_assert_position_pacific:0 "Assert Position in the Pacific"
JAP_ww1_assert_position_pacific_desc:0 "While the Pacific is rightfully ordained Japanese territory, there are technically enough islands to share with our so-called friends, for now. Japan's first focus will be the islands of our regional rivals, which we must expand into, at any cost."

JAP_ww1_Support_USA:0 "Improve Relations with USA"
JAP_ww1_Support_USA_desc:0 "The Americans are on-again off-again friends of Japan. Sometimes, we are mutual allies trying to keep peace and go against Europe, and sometimes we are bitter rivals fighting each other for pacific influence. Today, to ensure that Entente war plans don't fall apart, we shall be friends."

JAP_ww1_Support_Filipinos_Separatists:0 "Support Filipino Separatists"
JAP_ww1_Support_Filipinos_Separatists_desc:0 "The Yankees are no friend to us, and seem unlikely to play any real part in the war effort. If we help to arm and organize the Filipino rebels, a Filipino government may throw off American shackles- one that answers to Japan first and foremost, helping our presence in the region. Though, this may hurt our relationship with the United States."

JAP_ww1_Diplomatic_Siam:0 "Send Diplomats to Siam"
JAP_ww1_Diplomatic_Siam_desc:0 "Siam is the only other independent, stable power in East or South-East Asia. They seem to be a natural ally, and it would be damned foolish for us not to try and make friends with them."

JAP_ww1_ready_country:0 "Prepare for War"
JAP_ww1_ready_country_desc:0 "The tensions in Europe have reached a boiling point, to Japan's advantage. No matter who we face, we must first and foremost be ready to fight!"

JAP_ww1_defense_border:0 "Fortress Japan"
JAP_ww1_defense_border_desc:0 "Japan is an island nation, which carries benefits and risks. The most dire risk being anyone who lands too close to the capital could simply oust our government, and our low landmass means that a few divisions may secure giant portions of our territory quickly. Japan must be unassailable, or it will not survive."

JAP_ww1_Japan_Korea_Treaty:0 "Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty"
JAP_ww1_Japan_Korea_Treaty_desc:0 "Korea has been long a puppet state of our empire, but it would serve better as territory. If we force the puppet Emperor into an annexation agreement, we can knock it off the map in a fashion just seemingly diplomatic enough to keep Europe and the Americans off of our backs, which will establish our first territory on the Asian mainland."

JAP_ww1_Japanese_Expansionism:0 "Japanese Expansionism"
JAP_ww1_Japanese_Expansionism_desc:0 "The most logical solution to Japan's issues of low amounts of natural resources and tenuous defensive position is simply to expand outwards. If we expand onto the Asian mainland and farther out into the Pacific, we will control the supplies we need, and the outposts we deserve."

JAP_ww1_War_in_Europe_Opportunity:0 "War in Europe Opportunity"
JAP_ww1_War_in_Europe_Opportunity_desc:0 "The war in Europe is a grand opportunity for Japan! Though we are a nominal British ally, we could choose to join either side. Logically, the best thing to do would be to join the winning side, and profit from the spoils."

JAP_ww1_Pro_German:0 "Pro-German Policy"
JAP_ww1_Pro_German_desc:0 "The Germans are much like the Japanese, in both their world position and military might. Beginning a push towards their side will align Japan closer to the Central Powers."

JAP_ww1_Pro_British:0 "Pro-British Policy"
JAP_ww1_Pro_British_desc:0 "The British are technically allied to us, and were one of the few European nations to invest heavily in Japan's navy. Siding with them will, if nothing else, ensure we never have to face the fearsome Royal Navy until we're prepared."

JAP_ww1_Claims_on_Pacific_Islands:0 "Claim Pacific Islands"
JAP_ww1_Claims_on_Pacific_Islands_desc:0 "The Pacific Islands are the most logical place for Japan to expand. If we seize larger parts of the pacific, we can ensure anyone who seeks to attack Japan from the east has a long way to go. Laying down claim to these islands now could pay off at a future peace conference."

JAP_ww1_Join_Central_Power:0 "Join Central Powers"
JAP_ww1_Join_Central_Power_desc:0 "The weakness of the Entente, as well as easy and mostly defended targets in the east, have given Japan a grand opportunity to expand into the Pacific and Oceania. Joining the Central Powers will ensure a glorious Japanese empire for years to come!"

JAP_ww1_Join_Entente:0 "Join Entente"
JAP_ww1_Join_Entente_desc:0 "The Central Powers are far too tied up in Europe to do anything about Japan's expansionism, luckily for us. By becoming a fully fledged member of the Entente, we can take control over the entire German Pacific, and quite easily to boot."

JAP_ww1_Invade_Singapore:0 "Invade Singapore"
JAP_ww1_Invade_Singapore_desc:0 "Singapore is a major British port in Asia, in position to allow them to continue control over Hong Kong, help keep the Pacific secured, and other unfortunate benefits. If we simply oust them from the area- perhaps from the rest of Malaya as well- we can ensure that their ships will have no safe port so close to Japan."

JAP_ww1_Siege_of_Tsingtao:0 "Siege of Tsingtao"
JAP_ww1_Siege_of_Tsingtao_desc:0 "Qingdao is one of Germany's most valuable, least protected colonies. Seizing the area now will ensure no Imperial ships raid our shores, and give Japan yet another solid territory on the Mainland of China."

JAP_ww1_Xinhai_Revolution_Opportunity:0 "Xinhai Revolution Opportunity"
JAP_ww1_Xinhai_Revolution_Opportunity_desc:0 "With the Chinese nation in a state of heavy civil war, Japan can easily profit off of their misery. Perhaps, if we're lucky enough, we could even force them into the status of a puppet state!" 

JAP_ww1_Thirteen_Demands:0 "Thirteen Demands"
JAP_ww1_Thirteen_Demands_desc:0 "Though China would be in no position to resist Japan, the rest of the European powers as well as the United States are unified in threatening us with an embargo in the case of going too far with China. If we simply demand an inheiritance to the German economic sphere, we can expand our influence in China without damaging our position." 

JAP_ww1_Twenty_One_Demands:0 "Twenty-One Demands"
JAP_ww1_Twenty_One_Demands_desc:0 "Though the West may denounce us for it, China as a puppet state is a deal far too good to pass up. With their manpower and resources and our cunning and might, we would be an unstoppable force! Of course, if they reject our demands, we may have to either revise, or prepare for a war which would most certainly unify the dissenting powers..."

JAP_ww1_Appeasement_China:0 "Appeasement with China"
JAP_ww1_Appeasement_China_desc:0 "China is in a position to give a little, but it would be better for us both to walk out saving face. If we seek the route of mutual appeasement, we will continue our influence growth in China, without necessarily putting ourselves in any sort of diplomatic danger."

JAP_ww1_Pressure_China:0 "Pressure China"
JAP_ww1_Pressure_China_desc:0 "It is only a matter of time until Japan dominates East Asia. China is a crucial step to our brilliant master plan! If they do not acede to Japanese influence, perhaps the threat of gunboat diplomacy will get them closer in line...though this will create a dreadful crisis with the European powers."

JAP_ww1_South_Manchuria_Railway_Zone:0 "South Manchuria Railway Zone"
JAP_ww1_South_Manchuria_Railway_Zone_desc:0 "We have controlled the South Manchuria Railway since 1905. However, with China too tied up in its civil war to resist, we can easily expand precisely what it means to control the railways and what is southern Manchuria, until we have near full control of the region. And due to the war, it's unlikely they'd ever be able to resist."

JAP_ww1_Claim_Manchuria:0 "Claim Manchuria"
JAP_ww1_Claim_Manchuria_desc:0 "Now that the Manchurian Qing dynasty no longer exercizes effective control in China, we could garner a bit of local support for a Manchu government. This will nearly inevitably lead to conflict in war-torn China, but what could they possibly to do resist?"

JAP_ww1_siberian_intervention:0 "Siberian Intervention"
JAP_ww1_siberian_intervention_desc:0 "With the Russian Civil War in full progress, Japan must intervene in Siberia. Though the White Russians are no friends of ours, they make a far better neighbor than the Soviet Union. Besides, who knows what we might pick up from the expidition?"

JAP_ww1_Contest_Russian_Domination:0 "Contest Russian Domination"
JAP_ww1_Contest_Russian_Domination_desc:0 "The Russians hold themselves to be the Emperor of the East, the foremost authority in Eastern Asia. Have these fools forgotten already our last encounter? By adopting an Anti-Russian stance in the area and working against their authority, we will, of course, increase ours."

JAP_ww1_Celebrate_Tsushima:0 "Celebrate Tsushima"
JAP_ww1_Celebrate_Tsushima_desc:0 "The battle of Tsushima was a devestating blow to the Russian fleet, and one of Japan's greatest moments. Ensuring we seal the legacy of the event forever will not only serve to inspire our own population, but will be yet another massive blow to Russia's prestige and morale."

JAP_ww1_Russian_Revolution_Opportunity:0 "Russian Revolution Opportunity"
JAP_ww1_Russian_Revolution_Opportunity_desc:0 "The Russian Revolution has opened up a nice chance for Japan to earn yet more mainland territory. The port of Vladivolstok and the region formerly known as Outer Manchuria could easily be occupied, under the justification of course that we need it to continue the Siberian intervention. The westerners, as usual, may frown upon this." 

JAP_ww1_Leave_Entente:0 "Leave Entente"
JAP_ww1_Leave_Entente_desc:0 "The Entente has served its purpose to Japan, and it seems with recent events that it is no longer a group of friendly nations. It seems reasonable to assume, in fact, that Japan and the former Entente may one day be at odds with each other at war."

JAP_ww1_war_sakhalin:0 "Sakhalin is Karafuto"
JAP_ww1_war_sakhalin_desc:0 "Sakhalin is a very improper name for a Japanese possession. ''Karafuto'' seems much more proper!"

JAP_ww1_expeditionary_force_france:0 "Expeditionary Force to France"
JAP_ww1_expeditionary_force_france_desc:0 "Though the European war rages on far from Japanese shores, we would still be wise to assist our allies. By sending a small group to France, we can help make sure our friends actually win their part of the war."
