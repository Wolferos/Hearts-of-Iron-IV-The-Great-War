 AUH_ww1_Multinational_State_desc:0 "Unlike most countries of this period, the Austro-Hungarian Empire is not a nationalistically-organized state, but instead a relic of old marriages and throne inheritances, which have given the empire a cultural patchwork of territories. In recent times, many of the subject nationalities of the Empire have begun a push for independence, hurting the Austrian state."

 ww1_Faith_Allah_desc:0 "In the Qur’an, Allah commands believers to be united, to join ranks in faith, to regard and love one another as brothers, to be forgiving and protective and to strongly avoid fragmentation, division and dispersal.

 AUH_ww1_House_Habsburg_Lorraine_desc:0 "The House of Habsburg-Lorraine is one of the most influential Royal Houses of Europe, and the ruling dynasty of Austria-Hungary.

 German_staff_ww1:0 "German Staff"
 German_staff_ww1_desc:0 "The German Army, responsible for the continuous study of all aspects of war, and for drawing up and reviewing plans for mobilization or campaign. It existed unofficially from 1806, and was formally established by law in 1814, the first general staff in existence. It was distinguished by the formal selection of its officers by intelligence and proven merit rather than patronage or wealth, and by the exhaustive and rigorously structured training which its staff officers undertook. Its rise and development gave the German armed forces a decisive strategic advantage over their adversaries for nearly a century and a half."
 Austrian_staff:0 "Austrian Staff"
 Austrian_staff_desc:0 "The Imperial and Royal General Staff of Austria-Hungary was part of the Ministry of War. It was headed by the Chief of the General Staff for the Whole Armed Forces, who had direct access to the Emperor. The general staff was responsible for planning and preparations, while the Armeeoberkommando (AOK) was the operational high command. In fact, since the AOK was under the direct command of the emperor and the chief of the general staff was his chief adviser, in practice the AOK was under the control of the chief of the general staff."
 Franch_Staff:0 "French Staff"
 Franch_Staff_desc:0 "In times of war, the army chief of staff took charge of general headquarters (GQG: Grand Quartier Général). During the First World War, the leader of the French armies was variously referred to as supreme general (generalissimo) or commander-in-chief. In the closing years of the war, the establishment of the Supreme War Council in 1917 led to overall command being held by French general Ferdinand Foch, and by mid-1918 French army chief Pétain was subordinate to Foch. Although the war essentially ended with the armistice in November 1918, the war-time organisation persisted until 1920."
 ENG_Staff:0 "English Staff"
 ENG_Staff_desc:0 "The British Army during World War I could trace its organisation to the increasing demands of imperial expansion. The framework was the voluntary system of recruitment and the regimental system, which had been defined by the Cardwell and Childers Reforms of the late 19th century. The British Army had been prepared and primarily called upon for Empire matters and the ensuing colonial wars.[4] In the last years of the 19th century, the Army was involved in a major conflict, the Second Boer War (1899-1902), which highlighted shortcomings in its tactics, leadership and administration.
