 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "La tempête menace"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "De sombres heures approchent. En europe, Hitler a consolidé sa position et porte de plus en plus son attention au dela des frontieres allemandes. En Italie, Mussolini continue à se lancer dans d'audacieuses aventures militaires et l'empire du Japon s'apprête à attaquer la Chine. Vingts ans se sont écoulés depuis la fin de la Grande Guerre, et le monde ressemble de nouveau à un baril de poudre pret à exploser."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "Ca ne s'arrange pas !"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Ouaip, c'est vrai ! Cette collection de parapluie va vraiment devenir utile"
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Bien que le Royaume Uni soit sorti victorieux de la Grande Guerre, les fondations de son grand empire sont fragilisées. La fine fleur de toute une génération a été perdue dans les tranchées des Flandres et du nord de la France. De plus les troubles se répandent dans le commonwealth, et l'empire s'endette massivement.\n\nAlors que le traumatisme de la derniere guerre n'est pas éffacé, le pays doit de nouveau faire face. Il est de plus en plus evident que la paix n'est pas pour demain."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Malgrés la devastation causée par le Grande Guerre, la France est sur la voie du redressement grâce à une économie forte. Cependant, la Grande Dépression continue de frapper le pays et le nouveau régime Allemand n'a aucun interet à payer les réparations de geurre stipulées dans le Traité de Versaille.\n\nLorque le Traité a été signé, un maréchal Francais a fait remarquer que ce n'etait pas la paix qui etait signée. Mais un armistice de vingts ans. Et cette période arrive à son terme."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Une nouvelle Allemagne voit le jour. Trois ans ont passés depuis que la République de Waimar a été démantelée et remplacée par le troisieme Reich Hitlerien. Aprés les années difficiles de la Grande Depression, la stabilité économique est de retour et le chomage de masse est traité.\n\n Les restricitions militaires imposées à l'Allemagne par le Traité de Versaille sont mises de coté, et la Wermacht se renforce de jours en jours. Une autre Weltkrieg apparait à l'horizon."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Avec la montée du fascisme, l'Italie est entrée dans une nouvelle ere. Ses forces sont en train d'ajouter l'Ethiopie à l'empire colonial Italien grandissant, mais les ambitions de Mussolini ne s'arretent pas là.\n\n La domination de la Mediterranée à toujours été le destin de l'Italie et un nouvel ordre des choses prend forme en Europe. Lorsque le raz-de-marée du changement deferle, l'Italie doit surfer sur sa crete ou risquer d'être balayée."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "L'empire du Japon se trouve à un carrefour. l'Hokushin-ron, la Doctrine d'Expension Nord, et portée par l'armée appelle à une avancée en Sibérie. Le Nanshin-Ron, la Doctrine d'Expension Sud, soutenue par la Marine Impériale veut cibler les riches colonies européennes de l'Asie du Sud-Est et du Pacifique.\N\nET puis, bien sur, il reste la Chine. Le Japon possède une armée formidable, mais ses ressources sont limitées, et le temps passe. Quelle voie emprunter ?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Passé le désordre de la guerre civile Russe, l'U.R.S.S c'est imposée sur les restes de l'ex empire Russe. L'industrialisation est rapide, portée par le collectivisme, mais au prix de lourdes pertes en vie humaines. \n\nL'union Soviétique est maintenant confrontée à la menace croissante d'une Allemagne renaissante à l'Ouest et d'un Japon bélliqueux à l'Est. Sans compter les menaces dans les rangs même du Parti Communiste..."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict.
