# [GERMAN EMPIRE] Army Effort
#=========================================================================
GER_ww1_army_effort:0 "Deutsches Heer Focus"
GER_ww1_army_effort_desc:0 "The German Army is a powerful force indeed. Numerically inferior only to the Russian army, but far more disciplined, trained, well led, and well equipped than the forces of the Bear, our land force is among the world's greatest- if not THE world's greatest. However, that does not mean we can stay comfortably in such a position. We must continue to improve our military, especially on theory and doctrine, to ensure we never fall behind."

GER_ww1_trenchwarfare:0 "Trench Warfare Focus"
GER_ww1_trenchwarfare_desc:0 "Since Gatling and Maxim introduced their unholy weapons of warfare, our nation has been keenly interested in strategies based around the defense of Trench lines, which were first seen as far back as the American Civil War. We must seek experts in this theory- both field and armchair generals- in order to advance our knowledge in tomorrow's Land Doctrines."

GER_ww1_artillery_effort_1:0 "Artillery Effort"
GER_ww1_artillery_effort_1_desc:0 "One step to expand our young military modernization program is further development of our Artillery batteries. Seeking out designers for new weapons is a logical first step, and once our project is completed, we expect to reap the benefits of an easily-designed new Artillery piece."

GER_ww1_artillery_effort_2:0 "Artillery Effort II"

GER_ww1_artillery_effort_2_desc:0 "Now that we have gathered some accomplished Artillery designers, it seems logical to support their endeavors with their own factories. By assigning these men as full-time designers and engineers, and putting workers under them, we can easily make advancements in the field of Artillery." 

GER_ww1_artillery_effort_3:0 "Artillery Effort III"
GER_ww1_artillery_effort_3_desc:0 "Field tests are proving a major issue with our artillery pieces: The wide variety of calibers we're using for various ranges and models of Artillery is proving a costly endeavor, and reducing the effectiveness of our cannons on the field. By enforcing a few standard sizes for our guns, we can produce new models of Artillery that give us, quite literally, more bang for our buck." 

GER_ww1_artillery_effort_4:0 "Artillery Effort IV"
GER_ww1_artillery_effort_4_desc:0 "Though the direct-fire Field Gun was thought to be on its way out from the battlefield, our quartermasters are actually beginning to request more and more of these light pieces, instead of just demanding more of the Howitzers and Siege Guns. Focusing our efforts on new direct-fire guns, and perhaps more rounds to compensate, will not only inevitably lead to superior models, but perhaps lead to some unexpected advantages elsewhere as well..." 

GER_ww1_special_forces:0 "Special Forces Focus"
GER_ww1_special_forces_desc:0 "For all of its horror, Chemical Warfare has, by sheer accident, introduced us to a class of incredibly disciplined troops with lightning reaction times, superior to the other groups in our army. These men seem quite useful to act as Marines, Mountain troops, and other hardy classes of Infantry which are above the caliber of the standard Rifleman. Seeking out these men and good officers for them could lead to some much more effective Special Forces. If only there were a way for them to get to the battle faster, like the Cavalry of the old days..." 

GER_ww1_army_motorization_focus:0 "Motorization Focus"
GER_ww1_army_motorization_focus_desc:0 "Some of our geniuses in the General Staff- or perhaps just men fed up with the stalemates of Trench Wafare- have proposed mass-producing vehicles specifically for troop transportation, which would allow our men to get to and from battlefields faster- and, perhaps, around it as well. Of course, even this simple act requires specific equipment and training, which means an investment- though one that could easily pay off." 

GER_ww1_doctrine_effort:0 "Doctrine Effort"
GER_ww1_doctrine_effort_desc:0 "Though the era of the General Staff consisting of the princes of the realm has long ended, several of our Generals and other high-ranking officers were chosen for our armies not because of skill, but for connections or family ties. Though this keeps them loyal, other nations are beginning to become more serious and competitive with their own top brass. We must begin appointments for merit- though still, hopefully, not let too much of the common riff-raff into the esteemed General Staff..." 

GER_ww1_doctrine_effort_2:0 "Doctrine Effort II"
GER_ww1_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "Though our General Staff has now been made thoroughly merit-based, perhaps they aren't the only ones who can assist in our military doctrines. A class of men who have been mostly dormant since the early 1800s- straight military theorists- are beginning to appear once again. Though many of these men have limited combat experience, their study in war cannot be ignored. Integrating them into our staff could prove beneficial for our military tactics." 

GER_ww1_doctrine_effort_3:0 "Doctrine Effort III"
GER_ww1_doctrine_effort_3_desc:0 "One of our critical elements of warfare has largely been ignored up to now: Logistics. With so much focus on the capability of troops in combat, we must ensure they get there in a timely fashion, and have, at least, food, water, and a weapon. Giving experts on this subject a voice, as well as more training for supply vehicle drivers, would have immediate benefits for our land doctrines, but perhaps future additional benefits as well." 

GER_ww1_equipment_effort:0 "Equipment Effort"
GER_ww1_equipment_effort_desc:0 "Our generals are not the only old guard keeping our military in the last century. Our Quartermasters still have some of the 19th century Military issues of corruption and disconnection behind them. By selecting the most well-liked and in-tune officers, we can, most importantly, learn the faults of our current weapons, allowing us to produce corrected and improved designs more quickly- as well as ensure that these men don't get TOO popular!" 

GER_ww1_equipment_effort_2:0 "Equipment Effort II"
GER_ww1_equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "Our new Quartermasters have taken to us with requests for not simply newer rifles, but newer support weapons as well. Experience with this new-pattern army has led to ideas like lighter machine guns, trench mortars, and rifle grenades, which all seem quite useful, so long as we can get the right people on designing them and manufacturing them." 

GER_ww1_equipment_effort_3:0 "Equipment Effort III"
GER_ww1_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "The Quartermasters have sent a letter of demands for more rifles equipped for the conditions of trenches- those able to launch rifle grenades, attach bayonets or scopes, and more carbines. Though we could simply produce more straight up, it seems like a logical move is to bring our rifles to the standard of being able to do all of these things- which means a new, improved design." 

GER_ww1_equipment_effort_4:0 "Equipment Effort IV"
GER_ww1_equipment_effort_4_desc:0 "Our Quartermasters have, unfortunately, sent us yet another list of demands. Luckily, we have instructed our postmasters to ignore any further mail from them. Their last demand is new equipment for our Engineer corps- new models of Carbine, new tools, and perhaps those new Flamethrowers, which will be commissioned as soon as possible. Of course, expanding the Engineer corps as such could provide for some unseen benefits..." 

GER_ww1_armor_effort_1:0 "Panzer Effort"
GER_ww1_armor_effort_1_desc:0 "Our prior investments have paid off! Artillery designers, Engineers, and vehicle designers have proposed to us a brand new type of vehicle- a heavily armored tractor with a direct fire gun. Though early designs are clearly not battle ready, this concept has strong promise- particularly in the field of ending the Trench stalemate in our favor, if these landships can stand up to machine gun fire, as is claimed."

GER_ww1_armor_effort_2:0 "Panzer Effort II"
GER_ww1_armor_effort_2_desc:0 "Our experiments with armor have been a rousing success! However, we cannot be complacent with our current designs. Engineers have been proposing interesting concepts like rotating gun turrets, specific engine compartments, and a hatch for use by a commander, which cannot be ignored. If we are to be the first to make these ideas a reality, perhaps we could become unstoppable!"

GER_ww1_gasmask_focus:0 "Chemical Warfare Focus"
GER_ww1_gasmask_focus_desc:0 "Some of our chemists have proposed the use of a new, incredibly deadly agent- poisonous gas, delivered by our artillery and trench mortars. Though chemical warfare has been frowned on for roughly a century, what choice do we have if we are to win the war? Beyond investing in these, it's also likely for the best to develop countermeasures quickly- it would be unfortunate for such an advancement to turn on us!"

# [GERMAN EMPIRE] Aviation Effort
#=========================================================================
GER_ww1_airship_focus:0 "Zeppelin Focus"
GER_ww1_airship_focus_desc:0 "" 

GER_ww1_aviation_effort:0 "Form Luftstreitkräfte"
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_desc:0 "As one of the first nations to use a military airplane, we have a distinct advantage in the initial organization of a new Air branch of our armed forces. Despite this, there are still many yards of red tape, many debates, and many philosophical arguments to be had about this new branch's role and independence- which will inspire in itself advances in our doctrine."

GER_ww1_fighter_focus:0 "Fighter Focus"

GER_ww1_bomber_focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
 GER_ww1_bomber_focus_desc:0 "" 

GER_ww1_aviation_effort_2:0 "Aviation Effort"
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Now that we have formally established an Air Force, we have made some interesting advances. Most notably, our aircraft designers have been proposing designs for specific roles, rather than simply arming a generic model. Getting effective use out of these planes, which will be designed with roles like attacking enemy aircraft or dropping bombs in mind, will require extensive testing and research, but will no doubt prove beneficial." 
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_3:0 "Aviation Effort II"
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_3_desc:0 "The development of the Synchronised Machine Gun has changed the rules of the Aircraft game. Fighters are now far more effective, our Zeppelins might be seeing their last flights, and we need innovative thinkers to help keep us on pace with this extreme development. If we become the master of this new development, which will perhaps change the air war as much as ground warfare, we will be well on our way to Air Superiority." 
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_4:0 "Aviation Effort III"
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_4_desc:0 "Our Air Force, which was established only recently, has now integrated itself completely into the rest of our armed forces. This brings us the obvious benefit of a pool of theorists, engineers, designers, and experts still at our door- as well as a new class of ''Ace'' pilots, who are even becoming minor celebrities. Hiring on these people certainly can't hurt us, and will lead to nice developments in our field." 
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_5:0 "Aviation Effort IV"
GER_ww1_aviation_effort_5_desc:0 "With the development of brand new types of aircraft, such as the Tactical and Strategic Bomber, we have yet more testing and theorycrafting to do on exactly the best way to get use out of this influx of new models. Some are already speculating that bombers may be a wonder weapon capable of deciding a war. What poppycock!"

GER_ww1_pilotformation_1:0 "Pilot Formation"
GER_ww1_pilotformation_1_desc:0 "Currently, Aircraft fly solo- distant from each other, and engaging in one-on-one duels with any enemies they might encounter. However, with more and more machines in the sky, it's becoming clear that this is no longer the most viable way to engage in air combat. Some of our physicists may be valuable in helping us to determine new formations for our pilots to use."

GER_ww1_pilotformation_2:0 "Pilot Formation II"
GER_ww1_pilotformation_2_desc:0 "The new formations we have established have indeed been a boon to us in combat. However, ensuring people stick to the formations is a different story entirely. Encouraging our top aces to put out a manual for our pilots on air tactics and formation will ensure our pilots stick to doing what's best- and perhaps, these sorts of writings will help spread new tricks and doctrines."

GER_ww1_aircraftprod_1:0 "Aircraft Production"
GER_ww1_aircraftprod_1_desc:0 "Though Engineers have been making aircraft for us on a decent scale, it is simply time to introduce factories outright to the concept. Putting planes into mass production will help us flood the sky with friendly craft- and, more importantly, help us deprive our enemies of the same advantage. On top of that, who knows? Maybe some of these factory engineers may have some good ideas for aircraft designs..."

GER_ww1_aircraftprod_2:0 "Aircraft Production II"
GER_ww1_aircraftprod_2_desc:0 "The new formations we have established have indeed been a boon to us in combat. However, ensuring people stick to the formations is a different story entirely. Encouraging our top aces to put out a manual for our pilots on air tactics and formation will ensure our pilots stick to doing what's best- and perhaps, these sorts of writings will help spread new tricks and doctrines."

GER_ww1_airbomb_1:0 "Air Bombing Effort"
GER_ww1_airbomb_1_desc:0 "While the tactics of our fighters are improving with formations, our bombers are still very basic machines with very basic doctrines. Some of our old airship bombers possess now essentially unused expertise, which could help the latter as time solves the former. By utilizing these men, we can ensure that the old lessons of bombing are not lost on newer craft."
GER_ww1_airbomb_2:0 "Air Bombing Effort II"
GER_ww1_airbomb_2_desc:0 "All of the recent developments to air warfare, both in theory and in practice, have given birth to a golden age of aircraft development. From pilots down to the plane mechanics, it seems that everyone has something to improve and potentially offer, which we can use on a national level. Perhaps one day, Aircraft may be the most important weapon in war...nah, probably not." 

GER_ww1_air_innovation:0 "Air Innovation Focus"
GER_ww1_air_innovation_desc:0 "One of our aspiring, mid-level air officers recently displayed the conclusion of a project he had been working on in secret. A seaplane was launched from a static ship, dropped a bomb onto one of our old scrappers, sinking the poor old vessel, before the plane returned and docked once again. Though most of our high command was unimpressed, attention from the head of state could certainly give this ambition a boost."

GER_ww1_anti_fr_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, the Germans and the French have been enemies. If we act around this reality, it opens up new and interesting options to deal with them in the future."

GER_ww1_anti_uk:0 "Anti-British Policy"
GER_ww1_anti_uk_desc:0 "While the Anglo-German friendship was nice while it lasted, Germany and the United Kingdom have come to bear with each other in recent years, and it seems like this won't be reversed any time soon. Acknowledging our rivalry outright will open up some options to circumvent them diplomatically."

GER_ww1_support_boer:0 "Reinforce Deutsch-Südwestafrika"
GER_ww1_support_boer_desc:0 "DSWA, also known as Namibia, is one of Germany's most important colonies. Ensuring that it's defensible in an attack could serve to help out our nation's war efforts if it came down to it, and this would only take minor investment."

GER_ww1_support_boer_war:0 "Boer Revolt"
GER_ww1_support_boer_war_desc:0 "The Boers of South Africa are still only recently conquered, and not adjusted to British rule quite yet. If we supply and train some of the Boers who seek independence from the UK, they may be able to rise up against South African officials, giving us a rare advantage in a mostly Entente-controlled region of the world."

GER_ww1_agadir_crisis:0 "Agadir Crisis"
GER_ww1_agadir_crisis_desc:0 "With rebels organizing in Morocco, and just enough German interest in the region to proclaim them relevant, we can support their insurrection against the French goverment to try and seize Morocco for ourselves. While that goal in itself is unlikely, we can, if nothing else, shake down France for more reasonable territory if we grill them enough, though this may draw the UK even closer to them."

GER_ww1_assert_position_east:0 "Assert German Position in the East"
GER_ww1_assert_position_east_desc:0 "The position of the Central Powers in the East is the same- weaken Russia, and build hegemony in the region. As war with Russia in particular seems to be nearly inevitable, due to the Balkan situation, this is an effective course of action to take, though will drive France and Russia closer, which could prove to be an issue."

GER_ww1_anti_ru:0 "Anti-Russian Policy"
GER_ww1_anti_ru_desc:0 "Russia is no friend of ours, and perhaps never will be again, due to their extravagant claims on not only friendly territory but our own Polish land. Accepting this truth could lead to some new ways to deal with them down the line." 

GER_ww1_anti_serb:0 "Anti-Serbian Policy"
GER_ww1_anti_serb_desc:0 "The Serbians are rats, who would sell their own mother if it meant getting just a province out of Austrian Bosnia. If we face them as they truly are- an opposing state to us- we can prepare to stand against them in the future."

GER_ww1_bulgaria_puppet:0 "Puppet Bulgaria"
GER_ww1_bulgaria_puppet_desc:0 "Bulgaria proved with its lackluster performances in the Balkan wars that it is of no true use as an ally. Enforcing a puppet state over them may alienate some outsiders, but what does it matter? It's simply another impoverished Balkan hellhole, just like all the others." 

GER_ww1_bulgaria_friend:0 "Befriend Bulgaria"
GER_ww1_bulgaria_friend_desc:0 "Bulgaria has much to gain in a war against Serbia, and another two of our potential enemies in Greece and Romania. If we promise them claims on Macedonia and Thrace, which Austria-Hungary doesn't even have any desire to contest them for, they could join us, opening up a second front to relieve our overstretched forces, and give us another source of much-needed manpower."

GER_ww1_ready_country:0 "Prepare for War"
GER_ww1_ready_country_desc:0 "The Generals are anxious for a fight. They're starting to believe that the Entente forces are planning something horrible against us. We must prepare for combat, and we must be ready to make a preemptive strike, or else we may not survive a coming conflict."

GER_ww1_strengthen_kaiser:0 "Strengthen the Kaiser"
GER_ww1_strengthen_kaiser_desc:0 "His majesty's rule over Germany must be unquestioned. Even in turbulent times, he is the best man to fall back on, and can support our empire through thick and thin. Therefore, any measure we can take, from constitutional amendments to new laws in the Reichstag, must be taken to keep Wilhelm powerful."

GER_ww1_weaken_kaiser:0 "Weaken the Kaiser"
GER_ww1_weaken_kaiser_desc:0 "Wilhelm II has proven himself an...interesting leader, to say the least. Perhaps to ensure he does no further damage to the German Empire, it would be best to limit his control over the realm, and delegate more power to more capable hands." 

GER_ww1_restructure_ostafrika:0 "Restructure Deutsch-Ostafrika"
GER_ww1_restructure_ostafrika_desc:0 "East Africa is our foremost colony, but that doesn't mean we can't do more in the area. By expanding the role and administrative powers of the colonial government, they can effectively build up the region further for us."

GER_ww1_train_ostafrika:0 "Schutztruppe Deployment"
GER_ww1_train_ostafrika_desc:0 "Our colonial administrators have reported a large amount of local East African men who are unemployed fighters, looking to serve in the German army. If we can find some volunteers to train and lead this group, we could, if nothing else, hold out against British forces in the area as long as possible."

GER_ww1_war_with_france:0 "1915 Schlieffen Plan"
GER_ww1_war_with_france_desc:0 "It's finally time! France will be attacked through Belgium, and we will enter Paris while they're none the wiser! Our defenses in the east will be lackluster, but who cares? The troops from the west can be pulled in to help them! It must work! It WILL work, as the Kaiser wills it!"

GER_ww1_polnische_wehrmacht:0 "Polnische Wehrmacht"
GER_ww1_polnische_wehrmacht_desc:0 "If we promise the Poles their own nationstate after the war, perhaps the residents of our part of Poland will be more willing to join in on the action. Whether we cede the territory or not is, of course, a matter to be decided yet, but for now, we can enjoy the influx of able-bodied men without thinking of the consequences."

GER_ww1_hol_militaryaccess:0 "Ask The Netherlands for Military Access"
GER_ww1_hol_militaryaccess_desc:0 "Obviously, a war in Belgium will be more favorable for us if we can pass through the Netherlands, which would also give us an easy place to retreat to in case a battle went bad. Negotiations should prove successful, so long as we don't accidentally refer to their country as just ''Holland''. They hate that." 

GER_ww1_friend_sweden:0 "Invite Sweden to the Central Powers"
GER_ww1_friend_sweden_desc:0 "While it's a long shot, Sweden may be persuaded to join with the Central Powers if we promise to restore their hold on Finland. Though it's not terribly likely for them to accept such a proposition, we need all the friends we can get, and we lose nothing by at the very least asking, right?"

GER_ww1_finnish_civil_war:0 "Support Whites in Finnish Civil War"
GER_ww1_finnish_civil_war_desc:0 "A Civil War between the Reds, led by the Social Democratic Party and the Whites, conducted by the non-socialist, conservative-led senate has started in Finland. The Red Guards control the cities and industrial centers of southern Finland. The White Guards control rural central and northern Finland."
