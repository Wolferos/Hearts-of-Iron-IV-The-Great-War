# [FRANCE] Interwar
#=========================================================================
FRA_interwar_allied_occupation_rhineland:0 "Allied Occupation of the Rhineland"
FRA_interwar_allied_occupation_rhineland_desc:0 "Courtesy of the Treaty of Versailles, France has full rights of not only occupation of the Rheinland, but also full economic power in the region, a great boon to the French economy. If we take advantage of our tenure here, we can ensure that Germany's loss is France's gain."

FRA_interwar_annees_folles:0 "Les Années Folles"
FRA_interwar_annees_folles_desc:0 "The end of the war has brought upon us a great economic boom, unmatched by any prior. While some economists are warning that the good times may not last forever, they're just sticks in the mud and prudes. France and the French people will live it up while the times are good!"

FRA_interwar_occupation_ruhr:0 "Occupation of the Ruhr"
FRA_interwar_occupation_ruhr_desc:0 "The Germans are unable to pay their completely unreasonable debt to us, perhaps unsurprisingly, which is yet more opportunity for France. The Ruhr region is rich in resources and manufacturing, and we can simply expand our occupation of the Rheinland into the region as compensation for the missed payments."

FRA_interwar_great_depression:0 "Deflationist Program"
FRA_interwar_great_depression_desc:0 "The French government and populace has come to a rare consensus on the subject of the depression. It is a necessary evil, to rid the world of excess flowing cash and companies in over their head saved by speculation and governments. Let them burn, then, as France will simply steer herself for the imminent recovery! Deflation of the Franc will keep us competitive in these times."
