 # [Holland] Diplomatic Effort
 #=========================================================================
HOL_ww1_diplomatic_effort:0 "Diplomatic Effort"
HOL_ww1_diplomatic_effort_desc:0 "It is becoming increasingly difficult to stay in the middle of the affairs in the world as it stands. Our diplomatic corps is already asking if we're to be involved in the coming power struggle, or if we are to stay out of things entirely. While we can't answer that question quite yet, we can easily expand our corps to be able to choose one of these options."

HOL_ww1_supportgermany:0 "Support Germany"
HOL_ww1_supportgermany_desc:0 "With the German Empire's massive industrial sector, they seem to be the clear-cut bet, even if they are diplomatically isolated. Showing public support to the Germans on even a few, non-key matters will send a message that we're moving closer to the Central Powers."

HOL_ww1_supportfrance:0 "Support France"
HOL_ww1_supportfrance_desc:0 "Though France's industry can't compete with Germany's, they have far more friends, and we'd even be one more. By supporting France on in a few of the upcoming diplomatic issues, we may just win them over."

HOL_ww1_supportaustria:0 "Support Austria-Hungary"
HOL_ww1_supportaustria_desc:0 "The old empire of Austria-Hungary has lived to see the rise of most of the major nations on the world map. So, surely, if we want to become seen as a more major nation, what better country to support? This will also help us draw closer to the Central Powers."

HOL_ww1_supportrussia:0 "Support Russia"
HOL_ww1_supportrussia_desc:0 "The Russian Empire is in pretty dire need of international help. For the nation whose former leader coined the term ''Sick Man of Russia'', they cannot be particularly healthy themselves. Our support will, if nothing else, help them hang on long enough to do something decisive."

HOL_ww1_military_reserve:0 "Military Reserve"
HOL_ww1_military_reserve_desc:0 "War could easily come to our borders at a moment's notice, and therefore, we have to be prepared for the worst. A Military Reserve of loosely trained conscripts will be of little true value in the case of a war, but these impressionable young men getting a taste of the army life may very easily convince them to join the real thing."

HOL_ww1_embargo_germany:0 "Sanction Germany"
HOL_ww1_embargo_germany_desc:0 "Germany's illegal Submarine attacks are an insult to free trade! Though a sanction will draw us slightly further from neutrality, it will make us far harder to exploit by the merchants of the German Empire."

HOL_ww1_embargo_france:0 "Sanction France"
HOL_ww1_embargo_france_desc:0 "France's diplomatic scheming and backstabbing are unforgivable! Though a sanction will make us appear and act far less neutral in the war situation, it's unlikely to spiral into anything bad, and more importantly, will ensure France cannot take advantage of us!"

HOL_ww1_sellweapons:0 "Sell Weapons"
HOL_ww1_sellweapons_desc:0 "Though the tension of the world is the highest it's ever been, even this stormcloud has a silver lining. As we have no interest in joining the fight, we can easily hawk our weapons and weapon designs- even to both sides of a conflict, if we want- and make a killing off of the misfortunes of others. Their fault for starting the war."

HOL_ww1_joingermany:0 "Join Central Powers"
HOL_ww1_joingermany_desc:0 "The Central Powers have long been a friend to our nation, and desperately need help in these most uncertain times. Joining them is a one-way ticket into the war on their side, and we better be in it to win it if we are, but we could turn the tides to a decisive victory on their part."

HOL_ww1_joinfrance:0 "Join Entente"
HOL_ww1_joinfrance_desc:0 "The Entente currently seem to be in the better position to win the war, and we wouldn't want to be caught missing the peace conference once they do. Joining the Entente will definitely pull us into war, which could wind up disastrously, but at least we'll have allies to help, right?"

HOL_ww1_war_effort:0 "War Effort"
HOL_ww1_war_effort_desc:0 "With the world in its current state, we can't afford to let other nations pass over our military. By expanding our industrial base, we can ensure we'll have enough guns and shells to come out on top."

HOL_volunteer_corps:0 "Volunteer Corps"
HOL_volunteer_corps_desc:0 "Forcing our people to die for ideals of freedom would be an exercise in irony, but establishing means for those who wish to aid people abroad is not."

HOL_foreign_expeditions:0 "Foreign Expeditions"
