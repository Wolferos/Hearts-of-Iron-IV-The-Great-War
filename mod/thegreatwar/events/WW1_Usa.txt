	desc=ww1_usa.30.d #Since the earliest days of the colonial period, the issue of alcoholic beverages has been a hotly debated topic in what would become the United States. The religious roots of several of the thirteen colonies provided for a strong belief in the sinful nature of intoxicating liquors, and a variety of temperance movements made attempts over the nation's history to bring an end to what they often viewed as the social rot of alcoholism, which they frequently tied to numerous other social ills, with such thoughts being especially fervent amongst women's organizations that were often the subject of drunken attacks by their spouses. The issue has evolved, and after numerous state bans and repeals, the rise of major national groups like the Women's Christian Temperance Union and the Anti-Saloon league, the time has come for the Congress of the United States to debate a proposed 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which would ban the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liqours within, into, or out of the United States and its territories. Both the proposed ban and its opponents have strong bipartisan support, and the opinions of our national leader would go far towards swinging support in one direction or another.
