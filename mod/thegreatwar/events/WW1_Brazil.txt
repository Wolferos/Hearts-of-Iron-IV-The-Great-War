	desc=ww1_brazil.1.d#The Contestado War was a conflict between rebel civilians and the Brazilian military forces. The rebels of the Contestado region followed a local healer known as Miguel Lucena Boaventura who soon died in a confrontation with the Military Police. His followers refused to accept his death, however, and believed that he was either alive or would rise again. His story mixed with the Luso-Brazilian belief in supernatural assistance in desperate times. This phenomenon transformed the submissive population into a resolute fighting force. Their attacks on the railway and lumbering operations and the failure of negotiations with federal authorities led to an escalation of hostilities in 1912 and a fierce military campaign that involved 6,000 troops, modern artillery and machine guns. The fighting was spread over a wide area, and the many redoubts of about 20,000 rebels made suppression difficult and also revealed the military's weaknesses. The Contestado was subdued by the end of 1917.
