Habbalas TODO

-Lower PP cost for influencing foreign ideologies (ATM it costs 5PP!)
-Add more technologies (mainly things between 1910-1914)
-Modify trenches to be a cheaper, lesser, version of trenches (right now they have the same effect)
-Accepting treaties needs to take into consideration all potential major nation, such as Italy, Ottomans etc.
-Add decision tree for majors that depends on Central Powers winning WW1
-Add food mechanic (having less food than population needs decreases stability)
-Make stability more important. (Puppets gets released/States independant/Civil Wars at 0%, Ideaology drift defense -100% under 30%, and more)
-Make war support a major influencer on manpower
-Remove errors

BUGS
-German focus "Invite Sweden" will ask the player (Germany) to accept or deny (not Sweden)
-If a democratic nation (Sweden, Mexico, Romania, Italy) joins Central Powers via focus tree, they will leave immediately
-Second treaty of Frankfurt does not cede any Italian states/colonies, even if Italy was in entente.
-Event that says "Russia declares war on Austria" triggers 8/9/1915, even if they have already lost WW1. War isn't started however
-France declares war on Germany 19/9/1915, even if France just lost WW1
-Choosing to sign the treaty of Brest-Litovsk as Germany does not actually trigger the event
-Main menu background is from DLC?
